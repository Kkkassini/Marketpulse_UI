Can you provide an overview of the role of digitization in your companys strategy? . .Our companys brands sell in 180 countries and 5 billion customers use our brands daily.  . .We pursue an integrated strategy to realize strong, balanced growth and value creation. Five elements of our .integrated strategy are: a portfolio of brands whose performance drives choice, superiority of products that is .evident to customers to win, productivity to fuel investments, agile organization, and constructive disruption across .our businesses.  . .Constructive disruption spans across product innovation, manufacturing and packaging, communication and .marketing, distribution, and engagement with retailers, how to sell our products and lastly, the extent to which we .provide value to consumers and customers? . .Digitization is a pervasive element of every facet of our integrated growth strategy. Two important components of .our companys digital foundation are cloud and ML.  . .The reset of our architecture via emphasis on cloud and ML enables the agility and flexibility essential to thrive .since we encounter fierce competition in our businesses. . .We pursue a cloud-first and a multi-cloud strategy. Within this, we skew towards cloud-native systems across our .portfolio Vs. recreating our legacy on cloud with mere lift-and-shift. This has huge ramifications on our enterprise .architecture, organization design and skills, and so on.  . .Organizational transformation requires substantial redesign, and retooling of existing people while injecting solid .external engineering skills to both achieve speed and teach the existing organization. . .The reason we're a multi-cloud company is because not all the clouds are the same. There are significant .architectural differences and capabilities in each one of these clouds and they all have a strength i.e. marketing, .IIOT, etc. We and other corporations have tried to force-feed a broad set of capabilities into different cloud .providers. It does not work!  . .This is only going to get exacerbated with edge computings acceleration with 5G. Edge computing will grow the .data that we have to manage exponentially, but we can also reduce cost if we move less data around. I keep telling .all our vendor partners that we have to defeat latency. We're not going to do it through basic physics; we're going .to have to change our business models, change our technology, our distribution, change everything that we're .doing. . .I also wish cloud consulting companies who try to pitch to us all the time would develop credible POVs on the .optimal multi-cloud mix for our business and within that by functions like R&D, Supply Chain, Finance, etc. . .Q2. How did your company go about building its digital foundation? . .A couple of years ago in support of building our companys digital foundation, we undertook a major reversal of an .earlier decision to outsource our network to British Telecom, and implemented a new core network based on carrier-.neutral facilities, SD-WAN technology and edge security.  . .This helped us modernize our 250+ network sites with internet connectivity and achieve 3x the speed of MPLS .connectivity at 70% cost. In cloud transformations, the location of providers data centers and the nature of .connections do matter I have seen companies having a suboptimal experience due to lack of attention to this .aspect. . .We have used innovative solutions like Aviatrix for ease in multi-cloud networking, ZScaler to massively simplify .secure access for remote users to both our enterprise systems and cloud, while realizing a zero-trust exchange, .reducing the need for backhauling network traffic and minimizing our attack surface.  . .For other aspects of cloud security, we use other solutions a couple are Ilumnio, Onapsis; TrapX Deception Grid .which is used across IT and OT assets, etc. . .Our network transformation ended-up being a critical enabler for the remote everything paradigm in the new .normal.  . .We also stood-up a new SOC, NOC and cloud operations center and have already moved thousands of customer-.facing & non-SAP applications to AWS, Azure and GCP. Increasingly much of the application development and .hosting is also happening on our cloud environments. While we have the necessary back-to-back SLAs with the cloud .providers the investments I cited are essential to achieve resilience in operations and grow our engineering skills. . .Our cloud engineering team is working to deliver a breakthrough developer experience when using AWS, or Azure, .or GCP in IaaS and PaaS modes. This team is progressively realizing IaC capabilities for automated provisioning, .CI/CD pipelines, security controls and guidelines, etc.  . .Since the cloud space continues to change rapidly, we emphasize orchestration capabilities to potentially plug and .play new solutions that meet our norms while phasing out solutions that have lost their edge or reached end-of-life. .Beyond a point we do not invest in a full-fledged and versatile multi-cloud PaaS-kind of solution layer since each .business area has gravitated to a suitable provider aligned to their needs. . .Naturally we are heavily focused on microservices and we adopt containerization - we move the containers into .zones of compute based on various considerations such as price, security, etc.   . .When working with the big cloud providers we have to navigate through multiple commercial inhibitors: strong-.arm negotiation tactics, their penchant for making money via add-on services (the rack rate for data egress at .\0.05/GB is not cheap), their tendency to create lock-in via proprietary solutions and linkage of concessions to .volume of usage (which are pretty material for a company of our size), pre-payments, etc. . .We adopt a central funding model for cloud migration to realize a time-bound and coherent cloud strategy. .Otherwise we run the risk of each function/unit buying-in or not, and the whole thing taking several years.  . .Further, post migration, to avoid endless debates of, Why am I being charged this or that? we keep costs constant .for a couple of years, in-line with a simple T-shirt like sizing model selected for each migrated element and service .package selected. . .After that we transition to the actual costs and hopefully, they become manageable for the respective functions.  . .Luckily we did not encounter the issue of bloating OpEx (cloud essentially moves CapEx to OpEx) since our hosting .was already outsourced. However, in the network transformation that I discussed previously we had the challenge .of OpEx being replaced by a spike in CapEx. . .Q3. What is your companys focus in data and insights? . .Our data strategies are tightly linked to our business strategies. Ill provide a couple of examples to illustrate this: . .Our company is increasingly making smart connected products (such as toothbrushes, diapers, razors, targeted .application of moisturizers, skin advisors, hair advisors, etc.) that use big data, cloud, AI/ML and mobile apps to .provide compelling experiences and services, subject to consumer opt in. . .To shift to individualization at scale for consumers we are using GCP and BigQuery to store and analyze our brand .and marketing data. This has required us to migrate all our consumer information into a data lake which is currently .at 4+ PB. BigQuery offers a guaranteed SLA of 99.99%. . .The data lake provides a unified view of consumers and allows us to effectively orchestrate omni-channel consumer .journeys, which means it enables to serve the right content to the right audiences at the right time on the right .channels; and maximizes media effectiveness.  . .Further, BigQuery Omni will help us exploit data irrespective of whether it is stored on AWS or Azure - we can .query data in one cloud and export the results to another, and perform further analytics against the combined data .e.g. advertising data and eCommerce data on 2 different clouds. It does not allow us to query data stored in multiple .clouds in one operation, since latency issues and data transfer required for this would make it inefficient. By the .way, we are also working closely on the evolution of Azure Synapse Analytics. . .In our company we rely heavily on data & insights to create signals to run our business.  . .Here we are working our way through a couple of big challenges:  .1. Ensuring consistent quality of the data signals (across purchase, supply chain, consumer data across media, .channels, and weather) that inform our decisions at a very granular and near real-time level. We use a lot of AI .capabilities for automated data quality checks and to realize self-healing of data quality issues ahead of .decision making .2. The integration and harmonization of these data sets. At our scale this is not easy; however, a combination of .process ownership, technology, and culture & reward systems is helpful . .Our data lakes serve as the repository where these integrations and harmonizations happen. We're on a journey .where cross-functional squads of data & insights, cloud engineering and security teams are figuring out what data .sits where i.e. on-prem Vs cloud? How do we create egress points such that the data can move back and forth as it .needs to maximize value while protecting the data? . .We have a rich history of using data & insights to make executive- and operational-level decisions for P&L .management to grow market share profitably via actions across pricing, marketing, promotion, manufacturing, .distribution, etc.  . .So, Ill pick a couple of relatively recent examples which have used ML to achieve constructive disruption. . .One is neighborhood analytics, which is the ability at a micro- and precise-level, to understand our consumers .needs and shopping behaviors, by combining various internal and external data sources. Based on this, we serve .them with tailored in-store assortments in their neighborhoods. We're also able to grow categories, because we .partner with our retailers to put the right products that will actually sell for each demographic and neighborhood. .This capability is operational across dozens of markets.   . .In some of our developing markets, we have distributors selling on our behalf to retailers their staffs average .tenure is 3 months. So, they don't know our brands and often there were situations where brands were being sold to .retailers merely based on an alphabetical sequence of brand names. Now we're using smart selling algorithms .based on big data and ML to recommend the next best product to sell to each store owner to grow his/her business. . .In our manufacturing plants we have developed AI apps that use NVIDIA EGX Edge supercomputing platform in .product and packaging inspection lines to ensure they meet the safety and quality standards, by analyzing .thousands of hours of footage to flag imperfections. . .I believe that in some years AI-ML will be much like electricity in that they'll be everywhere, and nowhere.  . .Q4. How is your company proceeding to realize a digital core? . .We run one of the largest SAP landscapes in the industry and are on a journey to move our systems to S/4HANA .and cloud because we view this space as offering experiences- Vs. transaction-enabling capabilities.  . .Experiences means we have to push to the edge While there is progress it's not happening fast enough. Once we .get there, we will then get to the point where we may need to have decision making completely decentralized and .interconnected (e.g., IOT through various protocols). . .Speaking of which, we have to think about how we're going to be approaching I/IOT perhaps more like a series of .interconnected brains Vs. a single brain. The advent of mesh networking could potentially enable this. . .Coming back to reality we have completed the build of a greenfield SAP S/4HANA Central Finance landscape and .we manage its hosting via a partner. This effort was preceded by enhancing the HANA layer with a Cascade lake-.based architecture with NVM, to aid large scale-up and scale-out. Prior to this we had also integrated Hadoop with .HANA to reduce TCO. . .Some of our guiding principles for this implementation were: standardization of SW for similar requirements; cloud-.ready; acceleration from new thinking, STP, etc.; future-proofing from a technical and data model standpoint, .uniformity via templates; and agile delivery. . .In CFIN, Reporting & Analytics has changed dramatically. Our users enjoy functions that were previously available .only in BW. However, we had to be very watchful with the way CDS views are sliced-and-diced since that impacts .the performance of reports. . .We utilized agile methodology and delivered feature packs every 3 weeks. We made heavy use of Solution .Manager for requirement work items, which in-turn links to the business process master list, process steps and .related documentation. The development and config units, solution content and transport files are connected to .these work items. Release notes and feature packs are automated out of the documentation from the Solution .Manager and they then go into the target system(s).  . .Our SAP PS systems are very complex with emphasis on e2e synchronization of the entire supply chain (incl. .updates to our manufacturing schedules in plants and orders of materials to suppliers) driven by real-time POS .data.  . .By way of examples: we use a best-in-class COTS platform for e2e supply planning, visibility, collaboration and rapid .and effective responses to unforeseen disruption and incremental business requests from retailers (now fulfilled .within an hour Vs. previously requiring 1 or more days to respond), across highly complex and interconnected value .chains. This platform uses a secure cloud integration to connect to internal data sources; with external sources that .provide logistics, supplier and customer data; and uses automation and ML to ensure high levels of services, lower-.levels of inventory and cost.  . .We use robots extensively for physical material and goods handling. Further, we automatically push data of varying .nature and sizes at pre-determined frequency into Azure based CDL as a case in point to further load PS data hubs. . .We are working on the S/4HANA transformation of our PS SAP systems to realize a digital core. This is a mega .project and its scope includes our digital manufacturing transformation, encompassing many SAP modules. . .This program has multiple workstreams, some of which are: master data governance, SAP landscape .harmonization from multi-regional instances, transition architectures, custom code conflict resolution, technical .object remediation, data archival to reduce the eventual HANA database RAM size, and so on.  . .Q5. What can you share about realizing a large S/4HANA cloud transformation? . .Given our scale and complexity we watch large-scale S/4HANA-related developments keenly. For example SAP has .recently extended the HANA DBs capacity for scale-out to 96 TB RAM.  . .Furthermore our SAP systems have to integrate with numerous retailers, some of whom are very large. We also gain .learnings from their S/4 transformations. One of them has achieved the largest S/4HANA scale-out deployment on .Azure. This retailer migrated its 100 TB BW instance to Azure in less than a day (they used data sharding; and a .network management utility to do a VM to VM transfer inside the VNet and to throttle the amount of data .transferred and that passed over ExpressRoute) while achieving a 95% query compatibility. . .This S/4 system has 15 modules, 12 environments and uses 750 VMs to run the SAP central app services and shared .services; and SAP HANA DB runs on 12 CPUs specially-optimized for mission-critical OLTP workload which are .deployed in Azure datacenters (SAP HANA TDI) with close physical proximity to the VMs running SAP central app .servers, to boost performance and minimize network latency. . .Transactions flow through a high-speed ExpressRoute gateway, a backbone network (to aid asynchronous .replication for DR), ExpressRoute circuits (a virtual network of Azure IaaS connects via a physical network to SAP .HANA) and a cross-premises gateway in the Azure virtual network is used to connect to the retailers on-premises .sites. To restrict network traffic, network security groups control incoming, outgoing, and intra-subnet traffic. For .security, data is encrypted in transit and at rest. . .The retailer runs 4 SAP HANA instances/region - 2 units each for primary and standby, for each production system. .This guarantees them 99.99% system availability. Asynchronous data replication from primary to standby supports .their 0 RPO. In the app tier, Azure Site Recovery supports replication, failover, and recovery. In the event of a disaster .it brings the central app servers and services back online based on metadata and snapshots it stores in its vault. . .Q6. How are you approaching your manufacturing transformation? . .Our PS value chain is vast and encompasses 130+plants, 250 shipping locations, 40 customization locations and .60000 external partners, and involves 1.5 billion truck kms/year. . .Historically weve used GEs MES across ~100 plants. Initially, with a view to replicating best-in-class practices across .our footprint, we gravitated to plant Vs. plant comparisons of production lines and individual machines.  . .Hence we used GE Predix MDC to quickly provide us with a holistic view of our operations across 70+ plants. It .ingested data incrementally and automatically, and structured it, using edge technology for communication, remote .configuration, monitoring and notifications.  . .However, as we progressed in our IIOT journey, we felt the need for: wider coverage of as many assets in our plants .as feasible, and extensive use of digital twins and edge computing especially with 5G. Consequently, we are .increasingly using our PDP solution (enabled in part by PTC Thingworx).  . .We chose a specialist implementation partner with IIOT, 5G and edge computing experience because of their .promise of: speed of connecting up things, quality of service, and 99.9999% plant uptime guarantee.   . .The initial rollout of IIOT-based monitoring & insights at 10 sites has been promising. For example, in one such site .the material data was stored in 22 systems, i.e., production machines, and multiple ERP and MES systems. These .were not integrated, and the data was in diverse formats. Hence at the beginning of each shift, the plants .production managers needed ~1 hour to verify that there was enough raw material in place. . .We solved this by pulling data from all the systems into 1 virtual data lake. The data was harmonized, analyzed, and .processed to provide real-time views for monitoring KPIs and material availability. It resulted in many economic .benefits: 50% reduction in change-over-time, increase in machine uptime, inventory reduction by 35% and e2e .synchronization of the supply chain.  . .In the absence of the synchronization, most of plants would make average shipments/day for each SKU way .beyond the optimal level (even after factoring in the average volatility of demand for that SKU), since plants would .focus on operating their individual points of maximum efficiency Vs. the e2e efficiency of the PS value chain. . .Our ambition is to expand the PDP solution to ~100 sites. However, this will take time due to the wide variations  .across plants. This endeavor will go beyond condition-based predictive maintenance of plant assets and trigger .improvement actions across the e2e line operations and material flow. . .Data . . . . .\"",

This has huge ramifications on our enterprise .architecture, organization design and skills, and so on.  . .Organizational transformation requires substantial redesign, and retooling of existing people while injecting solid .external engineering skills to both achieve speed and teach the existing organization. . .The reason we're a multi-cloud company is because not all the clouds are the same. There are significant .architectural differences and capabilities in each one of these clouds and they all have a strength i.e. marketing, .IIOT, etc. We and other corporations have tried to force-feed a broad set of capabilities into different cloud .providers. It does not work!  . .This is only going to get exacerbated with edge computings acceleration with 5G. Edge computing will grow the .data that we have to manage exponentially, but we can also reduce cost if we move less data around. I keep telling .all our vendor partners that we have to defeat latency. We're not going to do it through basic physics; we're going .to have to change our business models, change our technology, our distribution, change everything that we're .doing. . .I also wish cloud consulting companies who try to pitch to us all the time would develop credible POVs on the .optimal multi-cloud mix for our business and within that by functions like R&D, Supply Chain, Finance, etc. . .Q2. How did your company go about building its digital foundation? . .A couple of years ago in support of building our companys digital foundation, we undertook a major reversal of an .earlier decision to outsource our network to British Telecom, and implemented a new core network based on carrier-.neutral facilities, SD-WAN technology and edge security.  . .This helped us modernize our 250+ network sites with internet connectivity and achieve 3x the speed of MPLS .connectivity at 70% cost. In cloud transformations, the location of providers data centers and the nature of .connections do matter I have seen companies having a suboptimal experience due to lack of attention to this .aspect. . .We have used innovative solutions like Aviatrix for ease in multi-cloud networking, ZScaler to massively simplify .secure access for remote users to both our enterprise systems and cloud, while realizing a zero-trust exchange, .reducing the need for backhauling network traffic and minimizing our attack surface.  . .For other aspects of cloud security, we use other solutions a couple are Ilumnio, Onapsis; TrapX Deception Grid .which is used across IT and OT assets, etc. . .Our network transformation ended-up being a critical enabler for the remote everything paradigm in the new .normal.  . .We also stood-up a new SOC, NOC and cloud operations center and have already moved thousands of customer-.facing & non-SAP applications to AWS, Azure and GCP. Increasingly much of the application development and .hosting is also happening on our cloud environments. While we have the necessary back-to-back SLAs with the cloud .providers the investments I cited are essential to achieve resilience in operations and grow our engineering skills. . .Our cloud engineering team is working to deliver a breakthrough developer experience when using AWS, or Azure, .or GCP in IaaS and PaaS modes. This team is progressively realizing IaC capabilities for automated provisioning, .CI/CD pipelines, security controls and guidelines, etc.  . .Since the cloud space continues to change rapidly, we emphasize orchestration capabilities to potentially plug and .play new solutions that meet our norms while phasing out solutions that have lost their edge or reached end-of-life. .Beyond a point we do not invest in a full-fledged and versatile multi-cloud PaaS-kind of solution layer since each .business area has gravitated to a suitable provider aligned to their needs. . .Naturally we are heavily focused on microservices and we adopt containerization - we move the containers into .zones of compute based on various considerations such as price, security, etc.   . .When working with the big cloud providers we have to navigate through multiple commercial inhibitors: strong-.arm negotiation tactics, their penchant for making money via add-on services (the rack rate for data egress at .\0.05/GB is not cheap), their tendency to create lock-in via proprietary solutions and linkage of concessions to .volume of usage (which are pretty material for a company of our size), pre-payments, etc. . .We adopt a central funding model for cloud migration to realize a time-bound and coherent cloud strategy. .Otherwise we run the risk of each function/unit buying-in or not, and the whole thing taking several years.  . .Further, post migration, to avoid endless debates of, Why am I being charged this or that? we keep costs constant .for a couple of years, in-line with a simple T-shirt like sizing model selected for each migrated element and service .package selected. . .After that we transition to the actual costs and hopefully, they become manageable for the respective functions.  . .Luckily we did not encounter the issue of bloating OpEx (cloud essentially moves CapEx to OpEx) since our hosting .was already outsourced. However, in the network transformation that I discussed previously we had the challenge .of OpEx being replaced by a spike in CapEx. . .Q3. What is your companys focus in data and insights? . .Our data strategies are tightly linked to our business strategies. Ill provide a couple of examples to illustrate this: . .Our company is increasingly making smart connected products (such as toothbrushes, diapers, razors, targeted .application of moisturizers, skin advisors, hair advisors, etc.) that use big data, cloud, AI/ML and mobile apps to .provide compelling experiences and services, subject to consumer opt in. . .To shift to individualization at scale for consumers we are using GCP and BigQuery to store and analyze our brand .and marketing data. This has required us to migrate all our consumer information into a data lake which is currently .at 4+ PB. BigQuery offers a guaranteed SLA of 99.99%. . .The data lake provides a unified view of consumers and allows us to effectively orchestrate omni-channel consumer .journeys, which means it enables to serve the right content to the right audiences at the right time on the right .channels; and maximizes media effectiveness.  . .Further, BigQuery Omni will help us exploit data irrespective of whether it is stored on AWS or Azure - we can .query data in one cloud and export the results to another, and perform further analytics against the combined data .e.g. advertising data and eCommerce data on 2 different clouds. It does not allow us to query data stored in multiple .clouds in one operation, since latency issues and data transfer required for this would make it inefficient. By the .way, we are also working closely on the evolution of Azure Synapse Analytics. . .In our company we rely heavily on data & insights to create signals to run our business.  . .Here we are working our way through a couple of big challenges:  .1. Ensuring consistent quality of the data signals (across purchase, supply chain, consumer data across media, .channels, and weather) that inform our decisions at a very granular and near real-time level. We use a lot of AI .capabilities for automated data quality checks and to realize self-healing of data quality issues ahead of .decision making .2. The integration and harmonization of these data sets. At our scale this is not easy; however, a combination of .process ownership, technology, and culture & reward systems is helpful . .Our data lakes serve as the repository where these integrations and harmonizations happen. We're on a journey .where cross-functional squads of data & insights, cloud engineering and security teams are figuring out what data .sits where i.e. on-prem Vs cloud? How do we create egress points such that the data can move back and forth as it .needs to maximize value while protecting the data? . .We have a rich history of using data & insights to make executive- and operational-level decisions for P&L .management to grow market share profitably via actions across pricing, marketing, promotion, manufacturing, .distribution, etc.  . .So, Ill pick a couple of relatively recent examples which have used ML to achieve constructive disruption. . .One is neighborhood analytics, which is the ability at a micro- and precise-level, to understand our consumers .needs and shopping behaviors, by combining various internal and external data sources. Based on this, we serve .them with tailored in-store assortments in their neighborhoods. We're also able to grow categories, because we .partner with our retailers to put the right products that will actually sell for each demographic and neighborhood. .This capability is operational across dozens of markets.   . .In some of our developing markets, we have distributors selling on our behalf to retailers their staffs average .tenure is 3 months. So, they don't know our brands and often there were situations where brands were being sold to .retailers merely based on an alphabetical sequence of brand names. Now we're using smart selling algorithms .based on big data and ML to recommend the next best product to sell to each store owner to grow his/her business. . .In our manufacturing plants we have developed AI apps that use NVIDIA EGX Edge supercomputing platform in .product and packaging inspection lines to ensure they meet the safety and quality standards, by analyzing .thousands of hours of footage to flag imperfections. . .I believe that in some years AI-ML will be much like electricity in that they'll be everywhere, and nowhere.  . .Q4. How is your company proceeding to realize a digital core? . .We run one of the largest SAP landscapes in the industry and are on a journey to move our systems to S/4HANA .and cloud because we view this space as offering experiences- Vs. transaction-enabling capabilities.  . .Experiences means we have to push to the edge While there is progress it's not happening fast enough. Once we .get there, we will then get to the point where we may need to have decision making completely decentralized and .interconnected (e.g., IOT through various protocols). . .Speaking of which, we have to think about how we're going to be approaching I/IOT perhaps more like a series of .interconnected brains Vs. a single brain. The advent of mesh networking could potentially enable this. . .Coming back to reality we have completed the build of a greenfield SAP S/4HANA Central Finance landscape and .we manage its hosting via a partner. This effort was preceded by enhancing the HANA layer with a Cascade lake-.based architecture with NVM, to aid large scale-up and scale-out. Prior to this we had also integrated Hadoop with .HANA to reduce TCO. . .Some of our guiding principles for this implementation were: standardization of SW for similar requirements; cloud-.ready; acceleration from new thinking, STP, etc.; future-proofing from a technical and data model standpoint, .uniformity via templates; and agile delivery. . .In CFIN, Reporting & Analytics has changed dramatically. Our users enjoy functions that were previously available .only in BW. However, we had to be very watchful with the way CDS views are sliced-and-diced since that impacts .the performance of reports. . .We utilized agile methodology and delivered feature packs every 3 weeks. We made heavy use of Solution .Manager for requirement work items, which in-turn links to the business process master list, process steps and .related documentation. The development and config units, solution content and transport files are connected to .these work items. Release notes and feature packs are automated out of the documentation from the Solution .Manager and they then go into the target system(s).  . .Our SAP PS systems are very complex with emphasis on e2e synchronization of the entire supply chain (incl. .updates to our manufacturing schedules in plants and orders of materials to suppliers) driven by real-time POS .data.  . .By way of examples: we use a best-in-class COTS platform for e2e supply planning, visibility, collaboration and rapid .and effective responses to unforeseen disruption and incremental business requests from retailers (now fulfilled .within an hour Vs. previously requiring 1 or more days to respond), across highly complex and interconnected value .chains. This platform uses a secure cloud integration to connect to internal data sources; with external sources that .provide logistics, supplier and customer data; and uses automation and ML to ensure high levels of services, lower-.levels of inventory and cost.  . .We use robots extensively for physical material and goods handling. Further, we automatically push data of varying .nature and sizes at pre-determined frequency into Azure based CDL as a case in point to further load PS data hubs. . .We are working on the S/4HANA transformation of our PS SAP systems to realize a digital core. This is a mega .project and its scope includes our digital manufacturing transformation, encompassing many SAP modules. . .This program has multiple workstreams, some of which are: master data governance, SAP landscape .harmonization from multi-regional instances, transition architectures, custom code conflict resolution, technical .object remediation, data archival to reduce the eventual HANA database RAM size, and so on.  . .Q5. What can you share about realizing a large S/4HANA cloud transformation? . .Given our scale and complexity we watch large-scale S/4HANA-related developments keenly. For example SAP has .recently extended the HANA DBs capacity for scale-out to 96 TB RAM.  . .Furthermore our SAP systems have to integrate with numerous retailers, some of whom are very large. We also gain .learnings from their S/4 transformations. One of them has achieved the largest S/4HANA scale-out deployment on .Azure. This retailer migrated its 100 TB BW instance to Azure in less than a day (they used data sharding; and a .network management utility to do a VM to VM transfer inside the VNet and to throttle the amount of data .transferred and that passed over ExpressRoute) while achieving a 95% query compatibility. . .This S/4 system has 15 modules, 12 environments and uses 750 VMs to run the SAP central app services and shared .services; and SAP HANA DB runs on 12 CPUs specially-optimized for mission-critical OLTP workload which are .deployed in Azure datacenters (SAP HANA TDI) with close physical proximity to the VMs running SAP central app .servers, to boost performance and minimize network latency. . .Transactions flow through a high-speed ExpressRoute gateway, a backbone network (to aid asynchronous .replication for DR), ExpressRoute circuits (a virtual network of Azure IaaS connects via a physical network to SAP .HANA) and a cross-premises gateway in the Azure virtual network is used to connect to the retailers on-premises .sites. To restrict network traffic, network security groups control incoming, outgoing, and intra-subnet traffic. For .security, data is encrypted in transit and at rest. . .The retailer runs 4 SAP HANA instances/region - 2 units each for primary and standby, for each production system. .This guarantees them 99.99% system availability. Asynchronous data replication from primary to standby supports .their 0 RPO. In the app tier, Azure Site Recovery supports replication, failover, and recovery. In the event of a disaster .it brings the central app servers and services back online based on metadata and snapshots it stores in its vault. . .Q6. How are you approaching your manufacturing transformation? . .Our PS value chain is vast and encompasses 130+plants, 250 shipping locations, 40 customization locations and .60000 external partners, and involves 1.5 billion truck kms/year. . .Historically weve used GEs MES across ~100 plants. Initially, with a view to replicating best-in-class practices across .our footprint, we gravitated to plant Vs. plant comparisons of production lines and individual machines.  . .Hence we used GE Predix MDC to quickly provide us with a holistic view of our operations across 70+ plants. It .ingested data incrementally and automatically, and structured it, using edge technology for communication, remote .configuration, monitoring and notifications.  . .However, as we progressed in our IIOT journey, we felt the need for: wider coverage of as many assets in our plants .as feasible, and extensive use of digital twins and edge computing especially with 5G. Consequently, we are .increasingly using our PDP solution (enabled in part by PTC Thingworx).  . .We chose a specialist implementation partner with IIOT, 5G and edge computing experience because of their .promise of: speed of connecting up things, quality of service, and 99.9999% plant uptime guarantee.   . .The initial rollout of IIOT-based monitoring & insights at 10 sites has been promising. For example, in one such site .the material data was stored in 22 systems, i.e., production machines, and multiple ERP and MES systems. These .were not integrated, and the data was in diverse formats. Hence at the beginning of each shift, the plants .production managers needed ~1 hour to verify that there was enough raw material in place. . .We solved this by pulling data from all the systems into 1 virtual data lake. The data was harmonized, analyzed, and .processed to provide real-time views for monitoring KPIs and material availability. It resulted in many economic .benefits: 50% reduction in change-over-time, increase in machine uptime, inventory reduction by 35% and e2e .synchronization of the supply chain.  . .In the absence of the synchronization, most of plants would make average shipments/day for each SKU way .beyond the optimal level (even after factoring in the average volatility of demand for that SKU), since plants would .focus on operating their individual points of maximum efficiency Vs. the e2e efficiency of the PS value chain. . .Our ambition is to expand the PDP solution to ~100 sites. However, this will take time due to the wide variations  .across plants. This endeavor will go beyond condition-based predictive maintenance of plant assets and trigger .improvement actions across the e2e line operations and material flow. . .Data . . . . .\"",

Introduction to Technical Requirements.The Sourcing Strategy, as part of the 2020 IT Strategy, is a major step towards a systematic and factbased approach for optimizing our organization's supply base and improving the overall value proposition. Vodafones new Sourcing Model includes;. Multi-Vendor Marketplace. Insourcing strategy (Vodafone Technology Shared Services)      . Continuous Delivery & Supplier Performance Management.Consequently, the Operating Model is based on the following key points:. TheServices(Sourcing approach depending on the servie type to be procured). Two main enablers(are the basics for the multi-vendor landscape):. Delivery Factory: day-to-day coordination of the multi-vendor delivery: version control, environment mgmt., testing & deployment . Vendor Management: including Performance Management and Scorecard (several axes to evaluate across same SLAs), service review meetings, vendor relationship management etc. .For avoidance of ambiguity, Service Integration (SI) is defined as an approach to managing multiple suppliers of services (business services as well as IT services) and integrating them to provide a single business-facing IT organisation. It aims at seamlessly integrating interdependent services from various internal and external service providers into end-to-end services in order to meet business requirement..Structure of the Document:.This content of this document is either;.Informative.Or.Question to supplier that needs to be responded.All the questions that you see in ths document need to be responded in Vodafones RFP system called Ariba..In order to easily follow-up between the questions in this document and the system, the questions in the word document are marked in RED. .2. Architecture Vision.2.1. Application Architecture Vision.Vodafones Modern Platform Architecture (target architecture) is based on the Gartner Pace Layering methodology for categorizing, selecting, managing and governing applications to support business change, differentiation and innovation..The key elements of the Modern Platforms Architecture are:.Modular Platforms and API:. Consolidate Applications into Common Platforms with clear APIs. Modular target architecture underpinned by strong API Integration (CSM) and Data (CIM) frameworks.. Embrace a Global API strategy across all technology platforms (not just IT). Enables sharing and re-use of best practice between markets, technology platforms . Supports step-wise architecture evolution, transformation and integration of M&A acquisitions.IT Simplification. Simplify our IT, landscape reducing number of applications and applying a frugal approach in our cost structure. Decommissioning of low usage platforms, Optimization of Demand Management,  SLA adjustment. Business Simplification (products, processes) critical enabler for simplifying IT.Cloud Native Applications. Cloud Native applications are build to truly leverage cloud , not just virtualise. Choose fit for purpose cloud deployment models : public/private/hybrid  PaaS or SaaS. Cloud Native Applications enable elastic scalability , zero down-time upgrades and 24*7 operations. Enables reuse between markets through multi-tenant deployments .Disruptive IT innovation. Adopt IT architecture patterns and best practices used by Internet Giants to build Disruptive IT foundation. Introduce new innovative and disruptive suppliers. Build and Monetise Digital Services on disruptive foundation. Enables timely response (TTM) to disruptive threats and opportunities.Question to Suppliers .Supplier is kindly requested to explain (max 1 page) how they will support in implementing its architectural vision and what capabilities supplier can make available during the engagement..2.2. Elements of Modern Platform Architecture.Modular Platforms and API: Open API Strategy  CSM (Common Service Model).Vodafone will officially adopt theTM Forum Suite of Open APIs. These Open APIs include contributions from Vodafone as well as other Telco Operators and Product Vendors..This means:. A commitment to adopt and implement TM Forum Open APIs as fundamental element of each service providers IT architecture and strategy.. Software vendors will be expected to support these APIs in their products out of the box, and system integrators expected to be familiar with and use these APIs.. Vendors and system integrators support for relevant APIs will be mandatory in RFPs as of January 1, 2017..Many APIs from the TM Forum API Poster map have been directly lifted from the current Vodafone CSM catalogue. In some areas, TMF already has experience (working groups, catalysts) in areas that we are exploring in CSM, and so can inform our specifications from the start..We have agreed a roadmap to open source our Common Service Model APIs through the TM Forum and to work with other Telco Operator Groups to drive adoption of these Open APIs across our industry. We are also contributing to TMF API governance and TMF API Standards to ensure alignment between the internal CSM Governance process and CSM API Standard. Over time, through evolutionary governance, the convergence of CSM and TMF APIs will lead us from company-standard to industry-standard APIs..Questions to Supplier.Supplier is kindly requested to provide a Compliance statement to the above and explain (max 1 page) with what capabilities they will support Vodafone in implementing this. In case of Partial or Non Compliance the respective reasons need to be clearly explained including any suggestions on improving/re-scoping the requirements, without materially altering them, which may help Supplier reach Compliance..Cloud Native Applications:.Vodafones five year IT strategy recognises the need to drive towards a cloud-centric, API-driven architecture. The foundation of that cloud-centric strategy is the underpinning infrastructure and operating model, and a drive towards truly cloud-native applications from our partners over the next few years. By 2020/2021, our goal is to have 65% of our applications either replaced with procured SaaS, or matured to cloud ready or cloud native applications running in PaaS or IaaS cloud services.Vodafone has defined four distinct maturity patterns covering infrastructure, operations and applications as the basis of a staged transition to cloud-native applications. Those four patterns are:. Legacy: Physical Infrastructure for applications that cannot be virtualised.. Virtualised: Virtual Application Infrastructure for applications that can be virtualised, with traditional physical supporting services (like databases).. Cloud Ready: An Infrastructure Cloud Platform for applications that can be virtualised and made to appear almost cloud-native using out-of-band orchestration and automation for provisioning, change management, decommissioning and operations, but that still require infrastructure SLAs to assure service availability.. Cloud Native: A multi-tenant, elastic Cloud Fabric for cloud native applications..Questions to Supplier.Supplier is kindly requested to provide a Compliance statement to the above and explain (max 1 page) with what capabilities they will support Vodafone in implementing this. In case of Partial or Non Compliance the respective reasons need to be clearly explained including any suggestions on improving/re-scoping the requirements, without materially altering them, which may help Supplier reach Compliance..Disruptive IT Innovation : Micro-service Architecture.Microservice architectural styleis an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies..Questions to Supplier.Supplier is kindly requested to provide a Compliance statement to the above and explain (max 1 page) with what capabilities they will support Vodafone in implementing this. In case of Partial or Non Compliance the respective reasons need to be clearly explained including any suggestions on improving/re-scoping the requirements, without materially altering them, which may help Supplier reach Compliance..Disruptive IT Innovation: Open Source. Leverage mature Open Source technologies for  delivering  differentiated and innovative solutions.. Encourage suppliers to use open source technologies to avoid indirect vendor lock in.Encourage use of Open Source for Delivery and Operational toolset (example  for DevOps toolkit).Questions to Supplier.Supplier is kindly requested to provide a Compliance statement to the above and explain (max 1 page) with what capabilities they will support Vodafone in implementing this. In case of Partial or Non Compliance the respective reasons need to be clearly explained including any suggestions on improving/re-scoping the requirements, without materially altering them, which may help Supplier reach Compliance..2.3. COBRA Application Map and Marketplaces.COBRA (Combined OSS BSS Reference Architecture) Application Map (below) is a standardised way of describing the functional domains and solution areas across Vodafones global IT application landscape. It also provides the building blocks for describing the Platforms (target) Architecture..For example, the CRM, Billing and Commercial Order Management platform within the Customer Management Layer is defined by the following COBRA Application Map solution areas/ building blocks:.We have used the COBRA Application Map to define the Marketplaces used in this RFP. The attached spreadsheet (below) contains the mapping between the COBRA Application Map and the Marketplaces and the COBRA Application Map definitions.Questions to Supplier.Supplier is kindly requested to provide a Compliance statement to the above and explain (max 1 page) with what capabilities they will support Vodafone in implementing this. In case of Partial or Non Compliance the respective reasons need to be clearly explained including any suggestions on improving/re-scoping the requirements, without materially altering them, which may help Supplier reach Compliance..2.4. Strategy KPIs.As part of the strategy 2020, Vodafone is using a number of metrics to track the strategy implementation. While the responsibility for the measurement and reporting of those metrics is with Vodafone, the support of the suppliers would greatly assist Vodafone in particular with:. Forecasting of the metrics based on the solutions being planned with the suppliers. Ensuring the proposed solutions adhere to standards that promote reaching of the KPI targets. Data available from the supplier, where applicable, to facilitate the reporting.KPI Title: Cloud Adoption.KPI Definition: number of Cloud Ready or Cloud Native applications vs. the total number of applications.Target: 65% of applications are Cloud Ready or Native by 2020.KPI Title: Agile Adoption.KPI Definition: Application Development spend in Agile vs. total Application Development spend. AD spend is professional services spend both internal and external..KPI target: 50% of AD spend is in Agile delivery.KPI Title: CSM API Adoption.KPI Definition: Number of CSM APIs adopted in the market.KPI target: at least 100 CSM API adopted in each market by 2020.KPI Title: Application architecture simplification.KPI Definition: reduction in the number of applications at the end of the period vs. the number of applications at the beginning of the period.KPI target: 15% reduction in the number of applications vs. baseline. .3. Vodafone Integration Policy and Common Service Model.As of 2014, Vodafone Group commenced its integration strategy for application integration.  By utilising the TM Forum Frameworx Vodafone adopted the Information Framework (SID) as the basis of its integration information model.  The Vodafone information model (CIM) is positioned at the centre of the creation of Vodafone centric APIs (CSM)..In addition to the Vodafone information model and the Vodafone APIs, the Group Strategy and Architecture function within Group Technology is a contributing member of the inter-company partnership that have all signed up to the Open API manifesto.  Vodafone Group signed up to the manifesto in 2016..Vodafone Group has an objective to deliver standardised integration across the technology footprint of its operating companies and group functions by 2020.  This drive for standardisation will see all the Vodafone operating companies adopt CSM services as a standard for all new integrations and will continue a drive towards total standardisation by migrating existing APIs to the CSM standard in the same time period..Figure 1: Strategic Pillars.The Group Integration Domain is the developer and custodian of the Vodafone API Catalogue (CSM).  The CSM catalogue contains service realisations in XML and where available, services that are derived from the Open API standard for Rest.  All future Open APIs will be adopted into the CSM Catalogue. The catalogue also contains some limited batch realisations..The objectives of the overall programme are to:. Service reusability - services are designed with reuse in mind, so they can be positioned in many solutions without further modification. Service abstraction - the interfaces only contain the essential information required to invoke the service, hiding implementation specifics, allowing wrapping of legacy applications. Loose coupling - systems are connected without intimate knowledge of how each other work, so they are decoupled from their surrounding environment. Standardised service contracts/interfaces - creating a catalogue of service specifications allows us to build up solutions from a list of pre-packaged functional modules. Simplified architecture and cost reduction -Integration projects adopting CSM benefit through accelerated delivery, simplified architecture and reduced costs.. Consistent and common data model -  Vodafone CIM adapted for Vodafone business needs, provides the flexibility to easily integrate with different backend systems through a common data model. CSM catalogue roadmap is centrally funded by Vodafone Group. Mapping against strategic vendors incorporated - CSM APIs incorporate mappings against Vodafone strategic vendors and backend systems.3.1. Vodafone CIM.The Common Information Model (CIM) is a logical data model that relates each service to the Tele Management Forums Shared Information Model (SID) in its terminology and data payloads. The CIM specialises the TM Forum model to incorporate the business rules and offerings of the Vodafone enterprise. The CIM is also informed by the Business Capability Architecture (BCA) and the Tele-Management Forum eTOM Process model. The CIM has the following characteristics:. The information model consists of business concepts, their characteristics and relationships, described in an implementation independent manner.. It acts as a language for different stakeholders to communicate effectively and precisely.. It Provides a single common definition of important entities across Vodafone . It is the standard used for developing CSM services (interfaces) between applications (IT systems).3.2. Vodafone CSM.CSM is a suite of over 100 APIs that are used to expose business capabilities and data across the Vodafone IT estate. All CSM APIs are based on a standardised design and utilise a single logical information model (the Common Information Model, or CIM) which represents all business entities, processes and data existing in the Vodafone enterprise..Figure 2: CSM Context.Channels, Self-Care & Partners.Analytics & BI.Other Business Functions.Customer Management Layer.Service Management Layer.Resource Management Layer.CSM is a specialisation of the TeleManagement Forums Frameworx architecture and Open API standard for telecommunications enterprises, providing a high-degree of compatibility with interfaces exposed by IT vendors and other enterprises adopting TM Forum standards in their IT roadmap..The CSM suite delivers all API software and guides needed to deploy CSM APIs in Vodafone Local Markets..CSM software is developed by a specialist team within Group Technology Strategy and Architecture (GTSA), based in the United Kingdom..3.3. Vodafone Commitment to Open API.Vodafone is a key signatory to the TM Forum Open API Manifesto.  As the availability of the Open API releases are made public, Vodafone will adopt the new Open APIs into the CSM Catalogue.  All vendors can be certain that the releases of CSM services are updated to the last release of the Open APIs..3.4. Vodafone CSM Catalogue.Vodafone Group maintains a catalogue of the CSM Services.  The catalogue has two main parts..1)  A repository of intended services and their relationship to CIM and the underlying use cases.2) A full catalogue of published service packages, detailing the business and technical uses of the service.  The service packages for each individual service carry the previous mapping of the services in multiple operators and situations.There are standards and principals applied in creating each service package.  The Vendor must be sure to read and action the recommendations within the standards and user guide documentation.  All the document assets are freely available from the Group Integration Domain repository, or directly from the operating company SPOC  access requests are welcomed from Vendors working directly on integration projects for Vodafone Group..Each published CSM service package contains:. A Business Service Specification. A Technical Service Specification. An Entity and Capability Mapping Document. The matching API in XML, Rest, Batch (or all realisations where appropriate).In all cases the Group Integration team can assist the Vendor in navigating the catalogue and ensuring that the right services packages are used..At the time of writing, the CSM Catalogue contains over 120 CSM services.  The full Catalogue can be seen here:  CSM Catalogue Pages.As a guide to the extent of the services available a sample selection has been copied in Figure 3 below..Figure 3: Sample CSM Services.In all cases Vendors should visit the full CSM catalogue site for the up to date list and versions..3.5. Integration Architecture & Service Mapping.When working directly with a project or programme there are some good practices to note.  When designing solutions, the addition of CSM services to the design must be made at the start of the design process.  In all cases a project or programme service mapping must be completed to show where each CSM service will be used in the development of the solution..There are examples available of previous service mappings in each one of the CSM Service Packages..Additional help can be sought from the Group Integration team to enable fast start for Vendors and assist with the transfer of knowledge to the Vendor Integration leads..3.6. Working with CSM.All IT projects, programmes and transformations adopting CSM APIs follow the same basic methodology for solution design:. The solution target architecture is reviewed to identify CSM-relevant interfaces. Appropriate CSM APIs are mapped to the CSM-relevant interfaces. CSM API operations are mapped to the solution use cases. CSM API payload data items are mapped to the data items required by the solution use cases. CSM API does not have a requirement on a specific receiving technology.The resulting solution design is abstracted from platforms in the IT estate; the solution designer need only specify dependencies in terms of CSM APIs..3.7. CSM Operating Model.CSM Services are provided and maintained by Vodafone Group Technology throughout the delivery lifecycle.

Summary.Vodafone wants to create and maintain its competitive edge by early adoption of emerging technologies as a way of spearheading growth and driving internal efficiencies. Therefore in order to ensure that the emerging technologies are selected based on the organisational value rather than the latest trend hyped in the marketplace, Vodafone intends to formalize the emerging technologies and innovation management process aiming at the following benefits:. Avoid being carried away by the hype (objective assessment). Be selectively aggressive. Analyse innovations in a more sustainable, repeatable way. Raise IT profile as an innovation leader. Formalized ownership (avoid Ill do it when I have time syndrome).As such Vodafone intends to follow a process which is outlined in the following section. Suppliers are kindly requested to elaborate how they intend to work with Vodafone in supporting them with the management of emerging technologies and innovation adoption, along the lines of this process, suggesting also improvements to it as they see appropriate..5.2. Process.The main stages of the process are outlined below..5.2.1. Scope.The Scope stage provides business focus and context for emerging technology investments by identifying what organisational purposes should be served, such as supporting corporate objectives and key initiatives or overcoming business process bottlenecks. Scope also involves determining how aggressive the organisation is and wants to be with respect of emerging technologies including the acceptable level of risk. Activities include competitive analysis, visioning and scenario building and identifying business problems and opportunities. Key points include:. Business context and strategic objectives. Pace of pursuit (aggressive, conservative). Approach to risk.5.2.2. Track.The Track stage involves seeking out relevant technologies  those that match the organisations defined scope for innovation through emerging technology  from a broad range of sources. Tracking activities include understanding the position of a technology in its maturity cycle and identifying potential business applications and champions for the technology. This stage should capture results in a way that can be communicated to others in the organisation and that lends itself to further decision making. The track stage drives organisation to be proactive about finding worthwhile emerging technologies. Key points include:. Proactive research for new technologies. Position in its maturity cycle. Potential business applications.Some of the tools/ approaches include:. Technology Scan. Technology Profiles. Technology Readiness Level.5.2.3. Rank.In this stage, alternative candidates are sought by ranking the technologies and selecting those worthy of immediate attention. The aim is to identify those technologies that look most likely to bring significant benefit to the organisation with acceptable levels of risk. This involves asking probing questions about the potential of each technology and, where possible, comparing the value of multiple technologies against each other. A virtue of ranking multiple technologies at the same time is that it highlights the trade-offs that need to be made in the terms of resource allocation  that is if one persons pet technology is pursued, those resources (people and money) are not being spent on some others, and perhaps more worthy, technology. Ranking is key, but often overlooked, step in emerging technology adoption. Key points include:. Analysis, Probing of new technologies. Side by side value comparison. Resource allocation decisions/ trade offs.Some of the tools/ approaches include:. Factors for Ranking. Spider Charts. Hype Cycles. Radar Screen. Priority Matrix. Rating Scorecards.5.2.4. Evaluate.In this stage the organisation investigates each of the top-ranked emerging technology candidates where a lack of knowledge or understanding still prevents them from deciding whether to move forward. Activities include paper and hands-on investigations, as well as prototyping and piloting, to understand each technologys value, and eliminate or at least identify remaining risks and uncertainties. The evaluation stage builds in regular evaluation decision points, and the end-result stage is a decision whether or not to move forward. Key points include:. Paper and hands-on investigations. Prototyping and piloting. Decision whether to move forward or not.Some of the tools/ approaches include:. Planning. Benefits, Risks and Costs. Prototypes, Pilots, Champion/ Challenger. Evaluation reports or white papers. Making the decision.5.2.5. Evangelise.In many cases the people who identify the value of a new technology do not have the direct authority to tell others that they must adopt it. For each technology that is recommended to pursue, the organisation needs to inspire, educate and involve other people to obtain the cooperation and support of all those who will influence the successful adoption of the technology by the business. Marketing, educating, networking and engaging others takes place throughout the adoption process, but their importance is most apparent after the evaluation phase.  Key points include:. Inspire, educate and involve. Technologys business impact appreciated. Decision makers influenced.Some of the tools/ approaches include:. Marketing. Education. Networking. Driving Change.5.2.6. Transfer.At some point the chosen emerging technology needs to be transferred to another department/ supplier or project that will take the technology to full-scale deployment. This requires more than transferring the knowledge. In most cases the only way technology transfer succeeds is by transferring people  that is having knowledgeable staff work alongside those who must learn the skills required to deploy the technology. For successful transfer, the players ultimately responsible for driving the technology forward must be involved in the earlier stages of the aforementioned process, in particular the evaluation activities. Key points include:. Transfer to implementation team. Knowledge & skills, staff rotation. Responsibility for deployment & adoption.Some of the tools/ approaches include:. Identify recipient team (delivery). Training, briefings, demonstration, reports. Staff assignment, rotation. Level of involvement in the delivery.Questions to Suppliers.Suppliers are kindly requested to elaborate how they intend to work with Vodafone to support implementation of the aforementioned process in each of the stages, and what are the tools/artefacts/skills they will make available to accelerate the adoption and the realisation of outcome and benefits from the above process.

The notice must be signed by the Supplier.  The Supplier may thereafter submit a new or modified proposal, provided that it is received at Airbus no later than the proposal due date and time listed in Section 2.2 of this CFT.  Modifications offered in any other manner, oral or written, will not be considered.  Proposals cannot be changed or withdrawn after the proposal due date and time listed in Section 2.2 of this CFT..2.6.5 Collusion.By submitting a proposal, each Supplier represents and warrants that its proposal is genuine and not made in the interest of or on behalf of any person not named therein; that the Supplier has not directly induced or solicited any other person to submit a sham proposal or any other person to refrain from submitting a proposal; and that the Supplier has not in any manner sought collusion to secure any improper advantage over any other Supplier submitting a proposal. Evidence of collusion, directly or indirectly, among Suppliers in regard to the amount, terms or conditions of this proposal shall result in the disqualification of all such Suppliers..2.6.6 Gratuities.No person shall offer, give or agree to give any Airbus employee any gratuity, discount or offer of employment in connection with the award of contract by Airbus. No Airbus employee shall solicit, demand, accept or agree to accept from any other person a gratuity, discount or offer of employment in connection with an Airbus contract..2.6.7 Examination of CFT Documents.The submission of a proposal shall be deemed a representation and certification by the Supplier that they: . Have carefully read and fully understand the information that was provided by Airbus to serve as the basis for submission of this proposal. . Have the capability to successfully undertake and complete the responsibilities and obligations of the proposal being submitted. . Represent that all information contained in the proposal is true and correct. . Did not, in any way, collude, conspire to agree, directly or indirectly, with any person, firm, corporation or other proposing Supplier in regard to the amount, terms or conditions of this proposal. . Acknowledge that Airbus has the right to make any inquiry it deems appropriate to substantiate or supplement information supplied by Supplier, and Supplier hereby grants Airbus permission to make these inquiries, and to provide any and all related documentation in a timely manner. .No request for modification of the proposal shall be considered after its submission on grounds that Supplier was not fully informed of any fact or condition. .3.0 Proposal Evaluation and Selection Process.3.1 Proposal Evaluation.The Airbus proposal evaluation team will review submitted proposals in detail. .Airbus may require a Supplier's representative to answer questions with regard to the Suppliers proposal.  Failure of a Supplier to demonstrate that the claims made in its proposal are in fact true may be sufficient cause for deeming a proposal non-responsive. Proposals that contain false or misleading statements may be rejected if in Airbuss opinion the information was intended to mislead Airbus regarding a requirement of the CFT package..3.2 Response Evaluation Guiding Principles .Supplier responses will be evaluated based on criteria, including, but not limited to the following (note: order does not indicate relative importance):.3.2.1 The Suppliers Ability to Deliver Services . Qualifications and experience of the committed account team. Ability and committed approach to meet Airbus service and performance requirements for day-to-day operations and projects. Suppliers commitment and plan to deliver Services on time and on budget (e.g., monitoring tools, reporting tools, development of supporting procedures). The Suppliers quality commitments, including Service Levels and remedies for failure to achieve Service Levels. Suppliers demonstrated ability to meet CFT requirements as described in the Suppliers proposal responses (e.g., quality and relevance of references).3.2.2 Content and Quality of Suppliers Response. Quality and background of committed account and delivery teams. Responsiveness to the requirements and philosophy of this CFT, including the degree to which the response completely provides the requested information in the specified format. Appropriateness and completeness of Suppliers proposed Service Tower solutions, including response to specific solution questions posed in Enclosure A. The Suppliers plan to provide continuous, measurable, and improving services, including commitment to service improvements through operational efficiencies and innovations. The Suppliers Services transition plan, requirements, and related costs, with emphasis on avoiding any potential disruption or degradation of service during transition implementation. Suppliers expectations and requirements of Airbus to successfully maintain a good relationship .3.2.3 Flexibility Offered by Supplier.

Renegotiation and termination rights.3.2.4 Solution Costs . Commitment to maintain market pricing over the life of the contract through benchmarking and other means. Airbus total costs (Supplier fees plus costs to be retained by Airbus) for the proposed solution in the short-term and over the contract period. Commitment to support Airbus Service Levels, as stated in this CFT, at costs comparable to the marketplace. Opportunity to reduce Airbus long-term costs as a result of leveraging Supplier capabilities (reduction of tickets, reduction of unit cost, etc), thus reducing Airbus technology investment requirements without reducing service performance.In addition, and at its sole discretion, Airbus may determine and use any other relevant criteria..3.3 Optional Procurement Phases.At its sole option, Airbus may choose to perform some or all of the following activities related to Supplier selection..3.3.1 Supplier Presentations.Suppliers may be required to present the CFT response to Airbus and other Airbus representatives at a location, date and time communicated by Airbus. Airbus strongly recommends that the presentation be limited to the proposed account team, including the Program Executive, Service Delivery Managers, Transition Manager, and other response participants. Prior to the presentation, Airbus will provide an agenda to guide the presentation content.  There shall be no pricing information presented in this meeting..3.3.2 Proposal Clarifications, Due Diligence and Best and Final Offers.Airbus may conduct due diligence, clarification sessions and preliminary negotiations with Suppliers. These sessions will provide Airbus the opportunity verify and clarify Supplier responses and will allow the Supplier to clarify remaining questions regarding CFT requirements.  .Following clarifications and due diligence Airbus may prepare best and final offer (BAFO) requirements and Suppliers will subsequently provide a BAFO proposal. Airbus evaluation team may develop new BAFO proposal scores based on the BAFO proposals..3.3.3 Supplier Reference Checks .Airbuss evaluation team may contact Supplier customer references by telephone.  In addition, the team may arrange to visit Supplier operating centers and/or customer sites to further confirm and evaluate the proposed solution..3.3.4 Contract Negotiations.3.3.4.1 Supplier's Negotiation Team.The Supplier will deploy a senior negotiation team for the contract negotiations..Airbus desires that a Supplier negotiation team be led by their proposed Program Executive, who would be responsible for day-to-day operations..The negotiation team must be empowered to make decisions on all parts of the Agreement, including pricing and other key business terms such as service level agreements, events of default, liabilities, damages, etc., to be assumed by Supplier..The Supplier agrees to honor the spirit of this process by limiting contact to Airbus team members authorized to conduct the process. Any deviation from authorized points of contact will be grounds for response rejection..The Supplier negotiation team must include a senior lawyer.  The senior lawyer must have reviewed the Agreement and been directly involved in the development of the Issues List..Continuity in Suppliers negotiation team is to be maintained by the Supplier.  Adding new members to the team and/or substituting team members will only cause delays in negotiations and therefore should be avoided..If it is determined that the Supplier's negotiation team is not empowered to negotiate the Agreement, or if substitutions are made or if additional members are added to the team, the net effect of which is to delay the negotiations, then Airbus reserves the right to cease negotiations and require the Supplier to reimburse Airbus for expenses incurred in connection with the Supplier's failure to comply with the above procedures..3.3.4.2 Control of Document.Airbus will retain revision control of the Agreement, including all Schedules and Exhibits. .3.3.4.3 In Person Meetings - Location of Meetings.Any negotiations will be conducted at Airbus at times to be determined by Airbus.

"texts" : "\". . .Large CP companys cloud, data, and SAP transformation . .Q1. Can you provide an overview of the role of digitization in your companys strategy? . .Our companys brands sell in 180 countries and 5 billion customers use our brands daily.  . .We pursue an integrated strategy to realize strong, balanced growth and value creation. Five elements of our .integrated strategy are: a portfolio of brands whose performance drives choice, superiority of products that is .evident to customers to win, productivity to fuel investments, agile organization, and constructive disruption across .our businesses.  . .Constructive disruption spans across product innovation, manufacturing and packaging, communication and .marketing, distribution, and engagement with retailers, how to sell our products and lastly, the extent to which we .provide value to consumers and customers? . .Digitization is a pervasive element of every facet of our integrated growth strategy. Two important components of .our companys digital foundation are cloud and ML.  . .The reset of our architecture via emphasis on cloud and ML enables the agility and flexibility essential to thrive .since we encounter fierce competition in our businesses. . .We pursue a cloud-first and a multi-cloud strategy. Within this, we skew towards cloud-native systems across our .portfolio Vs. recreating our legacy on cloud with mere lift-and-shift. This has huge ramifications on our enterprise .architecture, organization design and skills, and so on.  . .Organizational transformation requires substantial redesign, and retooling of existing people while injecting solid .external engineering skills to both achieve speed and teach the existing organization. . .The reason we're a multi-cloud company is because not all the clouds are the same. There are significant .architectural differences and capabilities in each one of these clouds and they all have a strength i.e. marketing, .IIOT, etc. We and other corporations have tried to force-feed a broad set of capabilities into different cloud .providers. It does not work!  . .This is only going to get exacerbated with edge computings acceleration with 5G. Edge computing will grow the .data that we have to manage exponentially, but we can also reduce cost if we move less data around. I keep telling .all our vendor partners that we have to defeat latency. We're not going to do it through basic physics; we're going .to have to change our business models, change our technology, our distribution, change everything that we're .doing. . .I also wish cloud consulting companies who try to pitch to us all the time would develop credible POVs on the .optimal multi-cloud mix for our business and within that by functions like R&D, Supply Chain, Finance, etc. . .Q2. How did your company go about building its digital foundation? . .A couple of years ago in support of building our companys digital foundation, we undertook a major reversal of an .earlier decision to outsource our network to British Telecom, and implemented a new core network based on carrier-.neutral facilities, SD-WAN technology and edge security.  . .This helped us modernize our 250+ network sites with internet connectivity and achieve 3x the speed of MPLS .connectivity at 70% cost. In cloud transformations, the location of providers data centers and the nature of .connections do matter I have seen companies having a suboptimal experience due to lack of attention to this .aspect. . .We have used innovative solutions like Aviatrix for ease in multi-cloud networking, ZScaler to massively simplify .secure access for remote users to both our enterprise systems and cloud, while realizing a zero-trust exchange, .reducing the need for backhauling network traffic and minimizing our attack surface.  . .For other aspects of cloud security, we use other solutions a couple are Ilumnio, Onapsis; TrapX Deception Grid .which is used across IT and OT assets, etc. . .Our network transformation ended-up being a critical enabler for the remote everything paradigm in the new .normal.  . .We also stood-up a new SOC, NOC and cloud operations center and have already moved thousands of customer-.facing & non-SAP applications to AWS, Azure and GCP. Increasingly much of the application development and .hosting is also happening on our cloud environments. While we have the necessary back-to-back SLAs with the cloud .providers the investments I cited are essential to achieve resilience in operations and grow our engineering skills. . .Our cloud engineering team is working to deliver a breakthrough developer experience when using AWS, or Azure, .or GCP in IaaS and PaaS modes. This team is progressively realizing IaC capabilities for automated provisioning, .CI/CD pipelines, security controls and guidelines, etc.  . .Since the cloud space continues to change rapidly, we emphasize orchestration capabilities to potentially plug and .play new solutions that meet our norms while phasing out solutions that have lost their edge or reached end-of-life. .Beyond a point we do not invest in a full-fledged and versatile multi-cloud PaaS-kind of solution layer since each .business area has gravitated to a suitable provider aligned to their needs. . .Naturally we are heavily focused on microservices and we adopt containerization - we move the containers into .zones of compute based on various considerations such as price, security, etc.   . .When working with the big cloud providers we have to navigate through multiple commercial inhibitors: strong-.arm negotiation tactics, their penchant for making money via add-on services (the rack rate for data egress at .0.05/GB is not cheap), their tendency to create lock-in via proprietary solutions and linkage of concessions to .volume of usage (which are pretty material for a company of our size), pre-payments, etc. . .We adopt a central funding model for cloud migration to realize a time-bound and coherent cloud strategy. .Otherwise we run the risk of each function/unit buying-in or not, and the whole thing taking several years.  . .Further, post migration, to avoid endless debates of, Why am I being charged this or that? we keep costs constant .for a couple of years, in-line with a simple T-shirt like sizing model selected for each migrated element and service .package selected. . .After that we transition to the actual costs and hopefully, they become manageable for the respective functions.  . .Luckily we did not encounter the issue of bloating OpEx (cloud essentially moves CapEx to OpEx) since our hosting .was already outsourced. However, in the network transformation that I discussed previously we had the challenge .of OpEx being replaced by a spike in CapEx. . .Q3. What is your companys focus in data and insights? . .Our data strategies are tightly linked to our business strategies. Ill provide a couple of examples to illustrate this: . .Our company is increasingly making smart connected products (such as toothbrushes, diapers, razors, targeted .application of moisturizers, skin advisors, hair advisors, etc.) that use big data, cloud, AI/ML and mobile apps to .provide compelling experiences and services, subject to consumer opt in. . .To shift to individualization at scale for consumers we are using GCP and BigQuery to store and analyze our brand .and marketing data. This has required us to migrate all our consumer information into a data lake which is currently .at 4+ PB. BigQuery offers a guaranteed SLA of 99.99%. . .The data lake provides a unified view of consumers and allows us to effectively orchestrate omni-channel consumer .journeys, which means it enables to serve the right content to the right audiences at the right time on the right .channels; and maximizes media effectiveness.  . .Further, BigQuery Omni will help us exploit data irrespective of whether it is stored on AWS or Azure - we can .query data in one cloud and export the results to another, and perform further analytics against the combined data .e.g. advertising data and eCommerce data on 2 different clouds. It does not allow us to query data stored in multiple .clouds in one operation, since latency issues and data transfer required for this would make it inefficient. By the .way, we are also working closely on the evolution of Azure Synapse Analytics. . .In our company we rely heavily on data & insights to create signals to run our business.  . .Here we are working our way through a couple of big challenges:  .1. Ensuring consistent quality of the data signals (across purchase, supply chain, consumer data across media, .channels, and weather) that inform our decisions at a very granular and near real-time level. We use a lot of AI .capabilities for automated data quality checks and to realize self-healing of data quality issues ahead of .decision making .2. The integration and harmonization of these data sets. At our scale this is not easy; however, a combination of .process ownership, technology, and culture & reward systems is helpful . .Our data lakes serve as the repository where these integrations and harmonizations happen. We're on a journey .where cross-functional squads of data & insights, cloud engineering and security teams are figuring out what data .sits where i.e. on-prem Vs cloud? How do we create egress points such that the data can move back and forth as it .needs to maximize value while protecting the data? . .We have a rich history of using data & insights to make executive- and operational-level decisions for P&L .management to grow market share profitably via actions across pricing, marketing, promotion, manufacturing, .distribution, etc.  . .So, Ill pick a couple of relatively recent examples which have used ML to achieve constructive disruption. . .One is neighborhood analytics, which is the ability at a micro- and precise-level, to understand our consumers .needs and shopping behaviors, by combining various internal and external data sources. Based on this, we serve .them with tailored in-store assortments in their neighborhoods. We're also able to grow categories, because we .partner with our retailers to put the right products that will actually sell for each demographic and neighborhood. .This capability is operational across dozens of markets.   . .In some of our developing markets, we have distributors selling on our behalf to retailers their staffs average .tenure is 3 months. So, they don't know our brands and often there were situations where brands were being sold to .retailers merely based on an alphabetical sequence of brand names. Now we're using smart selling algorithms .based on big data and ML to recommend the next best product to sell to each store owner to grow his/her business. . .In our manufacturing plants we have developed AI apps that use NVIDIA EGX Edge supercomputing platform in .product and packaging inspection lines to ensure they meet the safety and quality standards, by analyzing .thousands of hours of footage to flag imperfections. . .I believe that in some years AI-ML will be much like electricity in that they'll be everywhere, and nowhere.  . .Q4. How is your company proceeding to realize a digital core? . .We run one of the largest SAP landscapes in the industry and are on a journey to move our systems to S/4HANA .and cloud because we view this space as offering experiences- Vs. transaction-enabling capabilities.  . .Experiences means we have to push to the edge While there is progress it's not happening fast enough. Once we .get there, we will then get to the point where we may need to have decision making completely decentralized and .interconnected (e.g., IOT through various protocols). . .Speaking of which, we have to think about how we're going to be approaching I/IOT perhaps more like a series of .interconnected brains Vs. a single brain. The advent of mesh networking could potentially enable this. . .Coming back to reality we have completed the build of a greenfield SAP S/4HANA Central Finance landscape and .we manage its hosting via a partner. This effort was preceded by enhancing the HANA layer with a Cascade lake-.based architecture with NVM, to aid large scale-up and scale-out. Prior to this we had also integrated Hadoop with .HANA to reduce TCO. . .Some of our guiding principles for this implementation were: standardization of SW for similar requirements; cloud-.ready; acceleration from new thinking, STP, etc.; future-proofing from a technical and data model standpoint, .uniformity via templates; and agile delivery. . .In CFIN, Reporting & Analytics has changed dramatically. Our users enjoy functions that were previously available .only in BW. However, we had to be very watchful with the way CDS views are sliced-and-diced since that impacts .the performance of reports. . .We utilized agile methodology and delivered feature packs every 3 weeks. We made heavy use of Solution .Manager for requirement work items, which in-turn links to the business process master list, process steps and .related documentation. The development and config units, solution content and transport files are connected to .these work items. Release notes and feature packs are automated out of the documentation from the Solution .Manager and they then go into the target system(s).  . .Our SAP PS systems are very complex with emphasis on e2e synchronization of the entire supply chain (incl. .updates to our manufacturing schedules in plants and orders of materials to suppliers) driven by real-time POS .data.  . .By way of examples: we use a best-in-class COTS platform for e2e supply planning, visibility, collaboration and rapid .and effective responses to unforeseen disruption and incremental business requests from retailers (now fulfilled .within an hour Vs. previously requiring 1 or more days to respond), across highly complex and interconnected value .chains. This platform uses a secure cloud integration to connect to internal data sources; with external sources that .provide logistics, supplier and customer data; and uses automation and ML to ensure high levels of services, lower-.levels of inventory and cost.  . .We use robots extensively for physical material and goods handling. Further, we automatically push data of varying .nature and sizes at pre-determined frequency into Azure based CDL as a case in point to further load PS data hubs. . .We are working on the S/4HANA transformation of our PS SAP systems to realize a digital core. This is a mega .project and its scope includes our digital manufacturing transformation, encompassing many SAP modules. . .This program has multiple workstreams, some of which are: master data governance, SAP landscape .harmonization from multi-regional instances, transition architectures, custom code conflict resolution, technical .object remediation, data archival to reduce the eventual HANA database RAM size, and so on.  . .Q5. What can you share about realizing a large S/4HANA cloud transformation? . .Given our scale and complexity we watch large-scale S/4HANA-related developments keenly. For example SAP has .recently extended the HANA DBs capacity for scale-out to 96 TB RAM.  . .Furthermore our SAP systems have to integrate with numerous retailers, some of whom are very large. We also gain .learnings from their S/4 transformations. One of them has achieved the largest S/4HANA scale-out deployment on .Azure. This retailer migrated its 100 TB BW instance to Azure in less than a day (they used data sharding; and a .network management utility to do a VM to VM transfer inside the VNet and to throttle the amount of data .transferred and that passed over ExpressRoute) while achieving a 95% query compatibility. . .This S/4 system has 15 modules, 12 environments and uses 750 VMs to run the SAP central app services and shared .services; and SAP HANA DB runs on 12 CPUs specially-optimized for mission-critical OLTP workload which are .deployed in Azure datacenters (SAP HANA TDI) with close physical proximity to the VMs running SAP central app .servers, to boost performance and minimize network latency. . .Transactions flow through a high-speed ExpressRoute gateway, a backbone network (to aid asynchronous .replication for DR), ExpressRoute circuits (a virtual network of Azure IaaS connects via a physical network to SAP .HANA) and a cross-premises gateway in the Azure virtual network is used to connect to the retailers on-premises .sites. To restrict network traffic, network security groups control incoming, outgoing, and intra-subnet traffic. For .security, data is encrypted in transit and at rest. . .The retailer runs 4 SAP HANA instances/region - 2 units each for primary and standby, for each production system. .This guarantees them 99.99% system availability. Asynchronous data replication from primary to standby supports .their 0 RPO. In the app tier, Azure Site Recovery supports replication, failover, and recovery. In the event of a disaster .it brings the central app servers and services back online based on metadata and snapshots it stores in its vault. . .Q6. How are you approaching your manufacturing transformation? . .Our PS value chain is vast and encompasses 130+plants, 250 shipping locations, 40 customization locations and .60000 external partners, and involves 1.5 billion truck kms/year. . .Historically weve used GEs MES across ~100 plants. Initially, with a view to replicating best-in-class practices across .our footprint, we gravitated to plant Vs. plant comparisons of production lines and individual machines.  . .Hence we used GE Predix MDC to quickly provide us with a holistic view of our operations across 70+ plants. It .ingested data incrementally and automatically, and structured it, using edge technology for communication, remote .configuration, monitoring and notifications.  . .However, as we progressed in our IIOT journey, we felt the need for: wider coverage of as many assets in our plants .as feasible, and extensive use of digital twins and edge computing especially with 5G. Consequently, we are .increasingly using our PDP solution (enabled in part by PTC Thingworx).  . .We chose a specialist implementation partner with IIOT, 5G and edge computing experience because of their .promise of: speed of connecting up things, quality of service, and 99.9999% plant uptime guarantee.   . .The initial rollout of IIOT-based monitoring & insights at 10 sites has been promising. For example, in one such site .the material data was stored in 22 systems, i.e., production machines, and multiple ERP and MES systems.

The data was harmonized, analyzed, and .processed to provide real-time views for monitoring KPIs and material availability. It resulted in many economic .benefits: 50% reduction in change-over-time, increase in machine uptime, inventory reduction by 35% and e2e .synchronization of the supply chain.  . .In the absence of the synchronization, most of plants would make average shipments/day for each SKU way .beyond the optimal level (even after factoring in the average volatility of demand for that SKU), since plants would .focus on operating their individual points of maximum efficiency Vs. the e2e efficiency of the PS value chain. . .Our ambition is to expand the PDP solution to ~100 sites.

I mean, do you think though, in this more digital, let's say market or disruption, this bowl, that there are some inherent things about technology that make it where it's less distributive in terms of how many companies and how just equal the pie is shared amongst many players, meaning even though you won't be a hundred percent winner takes all market, do you think in some ways with technology and the internet and the advantages of scale that it provides, that it will be less of a diversified kind of a more concentrated market, this whole digital insurance market then maybe existing, traditional markets of insurance.

"texts" : "\"Lemonade CEO Daniel Schreiber: How Were Reinventing Insurance (CEO Interview) (Ep. 188).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l8lfCFRf04.Speaker 0    00:00:00    Hi, it's Dave. In this video, I share an interview I had with Daniel Schreiber, the CEO of Lemonade insurance. They are a fast growing insurance company that recently went IPO earlier this year under the ticker LMND. They offer renters homeowners and pet insurance, and we'll be launching a life insurance product. This quarter. The focus of my interview is to try to dig deeply into the mind of the CEO and how he thinks about his company product and feature growth prospects. So I've been doing kind of like a deep dive into Lemonade or the past few months, and I've like read, your whole S one filing your whole road show, your whole videos interviews from you in the past few years, your co-founders your CFO, presentation of Barclays and kind of been talking to people and trying to really understand the company from like a very kind of deep and clear place.  .Speaker 0    00:01:00    And so, I kind of want to dig deep and really try to get a grasp of how you view your company, how you view the path forward. But more specifically, like my biggest focus is does Lemonade have like a truly far superior product than anyone else in the insurance industry and can Lemonade sustain and grow that advantage over multiple insurance industries? Because ultimately I think, a lot of the future right of, I think Lemonade will come down to how superior that product is and how you can grow that to see advantage over time. So kind of, I'm wondering to start out with, can you kind of share your thoughts on how you view Lemonade as a product compared to other insurance, but not just incumbents, but even can Lemonade be successful against other startups in other companies that are gonna be, trying to go digital?  .Speaker 1    00:01:55    Well, the incumbents are very formidable players and they have many things that we don't have, right. They've got to sometimes a hundred, 200, sometimes 300 years of data and history and brand. They've got sums of money that, seem astronomical by comparison, that have got tens of millions of customers, sometimes over a hundred million customers, dedicated to teams.  I, I got to know the CEOs of some of the largest insurance companies in the world. And I have to tell you, they're fiercely impressive people, thoughtful, understand the impact of technology, are forward-looking and, very cognizant of the threat and opportunity that technology represents. So I certainly don't want to sound dismissive of, of them at the same time. I've had a few CEOs of genuinely the largest companies in the world, say to me, Daniel, I fancy your chances more than I fancy my own.  .Speaker 1    00:03:03    They have a clarity of purpose and a clear lay of the land, but getting there from here. Yeah, it seems mission impossible. And that as to all of this legacy and a hundred years and tens of thousands, sometimes over a hundred thousand employees and brokers, and I remember chatting through the challenge with one of them and I said to him, listen, you're just the CEO. And he was a little bit startled by that. I said, every other aspect of your organization was architected with a different thing in mind and what you think you need to do. And I challenged him. I said, can you think, can you name five companies in the history of the world that reached your stage in your scale and were able to reinvent themselves in the way that you think you need to do?  .Speaker 1    00:03:56    And they not insurance companies, companies, and, and they couldn't. And the reason really is that so many of the things that appear to be assets from the outside, when you look at them, their distribution models, that brands, that technology, actually increasingly are transforming, transforming themselves at 15 into being liabilities. So you're the CEO of a fortune 50 insurance company. And you've got 40,000 brokers. When, you took on the job, you thought that that was a huge asset. Now, you're not sure. Maybe that's actually an albatross around your neck and it makes it more difficult to do what you think you need to do.  you've got a technology stack that dates back to the eighties and swallows one to 3 billion a year, but you still content it into a black box. It really is a black hole and you just pour money into it.  .Speaker 1    00:04:48    And it's just keeping up and you've still got cobalt base at the bottom of it. And the engineers who designed it have retired or died, and it doesn't seem like such an asset, or it really seems like something that's slowing you down rather than empowering it. You look left and right, and you've got these wonderfully, highly motivated people. Who've spent 30 years at your company and are senior levels of management, but they were groomed for legacy preservation, not for business transformation. And they're just not the right people for this mission. You wouldn't have hired them all those years ago for this. And the same is true throughout your company. And some of your, you want to hire that people that Google is hiring, but those folks don't want to come to your company. So you say, okay, I'll make some bold moves. I'll buy some companies which doesn't work either by the way.  .Speaker 1    00:05:35    But then you discover they've got shareholders who just want that 5% dividend year in, year out with no volatility. And they appointed the board. And from above, you've got that. And from below, you've got this and incredibly difficult. I can't, I wouldn't take can be done, but it is the classic innovator's dilemma.  and there are structural reasons that make it genuinely difficult for companies that were built and optimized for the industrial revolution, stepping into the digital revolution that just flat-footed.  and when they do try to be nimble and young and hip, sometimes it just looks silly.  a year into our business, I publish a blog posts, giving out awards for the number one copycat of Lemonade.  Liberty mutual took the prize for Lulu, which was a citrusy fruit that they launched with copying our logos and our, naming and our pricing and everything.  .Speaker 1    00:06:32    And it was just, it made you feel uncomfortable like square. And like guys have some dignity or an incredible company do something that's authentic to you. Don't try and be a startup. That's just not what you are. So it's one of those really tough things. It's the David and Goliath and which isn't a sound being dismissive of these companies. I am not come back in 20 years. They'll still be here.  but I fancy our chances and the chance of companies like ours, more in doing what we're doing in playing ARG, our sport.  I said to one of them, if you want to beat Kasparov, you have to challenge him to a game of basketball, not to a game of chess.  so it depends what game you're playing as to kind of what strengths you bring and the game that we're playing. They're not, well-suited you wouldn't architect them today to beat play that game. Okay.  and maybe we'll come back to the bit later, but I think that the differences as pronounced as they are today, they're not converging diverging. They're becoming more pronounced over time, large insurance companies.  .Speaker 1    00:07:38    And again, update the software that their core systems, I don't know, with what frequency it varies from company to company, but say once a quarter, a few times a year, yesterday we did 32 production pushes of software 32 and one day this month, we've averaged over 20 a day, including weekends. So you just realize that as pronounces, the differences are there's reason to believe that they become more and more pronounced over time. They don't converge the divert.  and then you come to the newcomers and that's a very different story. And that there are some companies that are interesting and impressive. It has been surprising. And to some extent, disappointing to me to see that there aren't more, when we started Lemonade, we were running like hell, because we assume that everybody is behind us trying to catch us. And at some point we turn around and there's one or two players out, but there isn't, this horde of would be Lemonade.  .Speaker 1    00:08:40    Other kind of companies out there, which is interesting. It's a prize worth fighting for, but there are not many people in the fight. So you can name three or four companies, but you probably can't name five, which is kind of shocking when it's 11% of GDP, 5 trillion industry. And, and I think that we were very deferential and respectful of all the different things that are being tried.  but we don't, we're not bumping into InsureTechs in the marketplace. We're not losing business to them today. We're much, much more focused on their incumbents than we are on the startups.  .Speaker 1    00:09:17    And it's difficult once there are two or three names out there and they're well-funded, and they've got the brand recognition out there. Those things start to create a moat. They scare away other investors, the capital requirements on non-trivial.  the data feedback loop starts creating a real flywheel. That means that the longer you've been at it, the better you are, the harder it is to catch up with you. And having said, all of that, it's going to, we spoke about in comments, we spoke about newcomers. One of the amazing things is you don't have to believe that Lemonade alone will be successful to believe that Lemonade will be successful. This is not a winner takes all industry. I, one of the CEOs that I was chatting about earlier said to me, I congratulate them that an incredible quarter, and they did have a hundred billion dollars, that year.  .Speaker 1    00:10:07    And I said, Oh, well done. Congratulations.  and he says to me, Daniel, we still only have 4% market share. And that notion that you can be a fortune 50 company, do a hundred billion dollars and be a bit player, just gives you a sense of the, at first approximation unlimited nature of the insurance space. So really we don't spend much time looking at our competition. Honestly, we, we are, we determined what we're going to do based on what our customers want. That sets our agenda, rather than looking ahead of us or behind us to spend too much time looking at what others are doing. This isn't ultimately a winner takes all business.  .Speaker 0    00:10:48    Yeah, it seems to me, that, a lot of Lemonade seems to be there. You're efficient, you're focused on efficiency is kind of striking to me. And it seems to me that the priority that you guys place on just being as efficient as possible, kind of like taking the ideal of what would it take if we just had the most absolutely efficient process in everything we do, it's it kind of seems to me a little bit like that was the mindset of how you set up the company. And my offer is like similar in lights. Okay.  .Speaker 0    00:11:28    Because I'm like one example is, when you look at, you talk often about, Lemonade being built on a digital substrate and how important that is. And when I think about that, I think most people don't realize how complicated, how convoluted and how just a monstrous of a beast, these incumbent software systems, and, everything is not like a lean system that manages, the sign up process or the claim process, or, customer service, all this stuff, but you made it, a huge priority from the very beginning to have one system that was super clean, super lean that you guys built yourself that could handle the entire process. And to me, like, I think that's underappreciated. I think that's not that easy to do, even from a pure software standpoint. Can you kind of share a bit, like, what, what, what was your thought process as you guys were tackling that problem and how has it been building that? Like how much dedication, how much focus, and what did it take to build what you have in a lot of that stuff? I think people aren't seeing all they see as the app, right. They see the signup process go okay. Or the claim process, but they don't see the entire backend software system that is running your entire operation in a way that's so lean and so efficient. So hopefully, hopefully you can shed some light on that.  .Speaker 1    00:12:54    Sure. First of all, thanks. I don't get that question a lot. And you're absolutely right.  as Sinai were founding the company, we did the rounds of seeing the systems that are available off the shelf and I'll share some of your story.  we were getting one presentation after that. I buy these off the shelf companies that support most of the insurance companies out there. And I think on the 11th company that we met, Shai comes out and he came out of all of them, kind of scratching his head. Cause it was, we were two people on a dog, with, scrambling, if our seed round of funding and wanting to run to market. And basically what came out of these meetings was it's going to be an 18 month project. You have to customize these big systems and a multimillion dollar investment for the software and services that you need.  .Speaker 1    00:13:49    And after one of the meetings, I remember Shai comes out and he says to me, Daniel, either, I'm totally not getting this either. I'm just missing something huge. Or I could code this on my Apple watch while driving home this evening. Now there was some hyper Bolduc cause he could code it on his Apple watch while driving home that evening.  but the systems that were out there presumably still are, may be helpful to huge legacy providers with all the complexity that they have to manage, but not one of them was right for what we wanted to build. And frankly not one of them was customer centric. When you come into our backend systems, we've got a system that we call blender and we the same attention to detail architecturally performance. And in terms of user interface that you see in the app, all of our teams sees in the backend as well.  .Speaker 1    00:14:44    And when I'm talking to a customer, I can see everything about the customer. We didn't grow by buying different systems and different companies and kind of combining them all, as you say, a single system. So questions that you ask, customer support, marketing campaigns that you engage with, claims policies that you've had to cover all a bit appears as a timeline, almost like a Facebook style timeline, which doesn't exist in the industry. It may sound like, know, obviously that's what you would do, but it isn't, you call up your insurance company and you say, Hey, it's David Lee. They say, what's your policy number. They don't know who David is. They know policies that policy centric, and the idea that that's how you would build a company around a policy rather around a customer was under an Atmos. So yes, we started from scratch what we found, and this will tie into what you're asking me an alternative. Well, you asked me before about competitive advantages.  .Speaker 1    00:15:39    I told the team a while ago and at the time it was forward looking and now I can say it's true in the rear view mirror. I said, the stuff that you see as a customer, that the presses that our competitors see is the 10% of the iceberg that protrudes above the waterline. You see a playful app that will sell you insurance. In a matter of seconds, you see a claims bot that will pay claims in a matter of seconds, et cetera. And then we do optimize for speed and efficiency, but not at the expense of customer satisfaction. We do have humans. You can speak to them, but if you don't need to, why would you want to, you just want a quick answer. The really amazing part is the 90% that you don't see the datasets, that those interactions generate the relationships between them that become available.  .Speaker 1    00:16:27    The web, that forms from all those different interactions in the three-dimensional picture that the data presents of David or Daniel and of the differences between us and how would every turn of the flywheel. Those become stronger and deeper and more insightful. And if you don't build a system yourself, if it's not your machine learning experts who design the algorithms, your software folks, if you don't have a single system that handles claims and customer support and policy underwriting, and then you never get to, to create that kind of thing. And you can't bolt it on afterwards, that has to be built. As I say, on a digital substrate. And it, it cuts across the company. So somebody from finance will come to me and say, Daniel, we need there's, businesses growing. We need some more people to help with financial filings.  .Speaker 1    00:17:19     we want to hire another finance associate and I'll say to them, are you sure we need another finance associate? Maybe we need another engineer, because maybe we can automate those things and the algorithms can find them and do it for you. And indeed, today we've got an internal bot just that you've got at soundbites and Tom Watson, somebody in finance, you needs reports for regulators chats through Slack with our buzzers. I need claims reports from this date to that date or whatever it is. And the second letter, it appears in that Excel in that Slack. And the same will be true when somebody from underwriting or other functions, hell we need more people I'll say, do we need more people always, there's something that technology can achieve. And time after time, we discovered that technology can do the things, the menial task and not only menial tasks that we used to think we needed to hire people for.  .Speaker 0    00:18:08    I'm curious, in terms of engineers, like how many engineers do you have in your company? Are you keeping track of that?  .Speaker 1    00:18:17     we have about 150 people in our product organization.  so that includes, most of those will be actual engineers and data scientists. And some of them are product designers, but it's something in that ballpark don't hold me to that number precisely, but it's an Apple park.  .Speaker 0    00:18:38    Yeah.  I remember, Steve jobs once said that, the, the beauty or, the angled apples, they are, they are at the intersection of science and humanities. And oftentimes it's, it's easier just to focus on one, like for example, being very tech heavy or the other side being very artistic or humanity focused, I noticed with Lemonade, there is this like blend I'm seeing, I'm picking up where the tech is quite amazing. And, and again, like you're saying, like, because so much of it is under the cover. Most people aren't picking it up, for example, on the app. However, like I have some, software background. So when I look at your app and I'm going through the interactions, I'm like, wow, this is pretty intense. Like the backend stuff is just amazing how you're able to, process risk on the spot, and, and not just that, not just the tech side, but then you have a humanity side where you're leading people through a very, just intuitive relational process, and your entire brand and whole interaction with customers has this very, just, kind of empathetic side that isn't very typical in a purely technical, focused approach.  .Speaker 0    00:19:53    And so I'm looking at this, I think people don't understand how difficult it is to marry these two things to hold these two values together in one hand, because oftentimes they can be diametrically opposed. Like how did you guys do that? Did you ha ha I mean, is that just innate values that you guys have, or know what was the background behind that?  .Speaker 1    00:20:14    So, so I wrote a blog post, a couple of months ago called Lemonade, DaVinci code and DaVinci in the sense of exactly the, the Steve jobs notion that, and Steve jobs had this DaVinci had it, but between those two, it's hard to find too many other names where when DaVita DaVinci saw a burden flight, he would think about heavier than, the physics of heavier than our flight had to think about the biology of wings and, and muscles and flapping.  he'd talk about, or think about the perspective of light and how it refract. And he think about the art and it draws a beautiful painting of it all, and ultimately come up with a proton helicopter.  and I said that our DaVinci code is my co-founder shy that our true secret source, is that shy more than any professional I've ever seen?  .Speaker 1    00:21:06     is this rare blend of, as you say, humanities and science, and you can have a conversation with him about the chamfer of the chatbot and the hue of the pink down to the nth degree, you or the design is, is really pixel perfect because Shai is that pedantic and artistic.  and the wording of the text that appears in that, but also I'm the native English speaker among the toolbox, but he won't let me near the tax because he had, he just has it. He just really, really gets that, through to what it takes to develop software that will deliver that a hundred percent precisely at scale securely every time and what it takes to build an organization that can do 30 builds of that kind a day. So she's just an extraordinary talent, really, really extraordinary. I've worked in tech for over 20 years, worked in Silicon Valley and met Steve jobs and Jeff Bezos and a bunch of other Eric's middle is great people. And I right there in the blog that if I could choose between any of them and chiles my co-founder, I would choose chai every day of the week. He's just, he's really that good. And I'm down. I think at this point, I'm hopeful that it's become inculcated into the fabric of the company.  and we've hired people in his image. And that now is part of the, part of the very nature of the business, but we got there through sheer force of size talent.  .Speaker 0    00:22:35    Yeah. I noticed, I had a feeling that the more I was typing into Lemonade, I'm like this shy guy, I think he's underrated because the level of technology, but then I noticed, he's into like behavioral economics, kind of the whole mentality where it's not just technology, it's also it's psychology and how people receive that.  I think that also is an interesting thing where it's like for people to compete with you, and let's say incumbents, it's not just that they have to, upgrade their stack and reinvent their stack, which is practically impossible for, multi hundred billion dollar company who has dozens of different,  systems that they didn't even build. Right. And, but not just that they have to also reinvent kind of their human side. Right. And how they react and not just react, how they interact and treat the customer, right. Not as a, just a policy holder or,  someone who is just, I dunno, a customer, but rather as someone on the same side, someone who you're trying to help and come alongside and prioritize as the number one kind of part of your industry or your company. And that, to me seems extremely difficult too. And so this two-sided approach where it's gonna be hard technologically for then Cummins to, to catch up, but also maybe even more importantly, the priorities or the values, and the relational side, I think it's extremely challenging.  .Speaker 1    00:24:10    No question.  when I'm asked about kind of the threats to the incumbents, and by the way, I, I, I'm not particularly, I use it sometimes, but I'm not particularly fond of the Monica disruptor. It carries kind of negative connotations, but, people think, and that the grammar of the word suggests that disruptors caused, caused disruption. I don't believe that that's what happens. I think that disruption causes disruptors. That certainly in our case, the changes that are happening are happening to the universe, certainly to earth, to the planet that we are living through transformations that are stunning in their reach. You'd have to go back hundreds of years, maybe to the scientific revolution, maybe to the cultural revolution, to see a change, as big as the kinds of changes that were happening in there. It lasted much longer. We've seen changes here that are happening at a pace that is exponential, not linear.  .Speaker 1    00:25:13    And therefore really is without precedent in human history. And it is that rather than Lemonade, that threatens the incumbents, Lemonade is a phenomenon we're trying to precipitate the way we're trying to ride the wave, but we're not the force. It's a secular shift. It's a systemic change in, in the world. That means that if you are set up to be broke, based, and as you say, not customer centric and do that, all these things that made sense in the 18 hundreds and have carried forward very difficult to change.  I, in my mind's eye, I liken it and I wasn't there. So I don't know if I'm doing justice or not, but in my mind, I play out a conversation around the boardroom of a big retailer circa 1995. I'll use Walmart, but they actually have done a better job than anybody else.  .Speaker 1    00:26:02    A lot of the other names have disappeared, but let's take Walmart for example. So in my mind, somebody comes to the board meeting of Walmart and circa 1995 and says, Hey, listen, there's this new website it's called Amazon. It's really pretty cool. And you can go on there and you can buy books. And now they're starting to sell other staff and maybe we should do something like that. And they think about it. They say, yeah, yeah. Hey Jimmy, HTML, why didn't you give it a try? And they think, and actually barons had a cover, a famous cover piece in 1999. The headline was Amazon dot bomb where they explain that Amazon doesn't stand a chance against Walmart. And they really don't. They're going to be eaten alive. As soon as Walmart turns their attention to this, Amazon is dead. And what I think they thought at the time was that Amazon has a website and Hey, Jimmy, you can make a website and we're done.  .Speaker 1    00:26:57    Let's move on. And here I go back to this phrase that I do use about the digital substrate. And you're talking about culture. When you build a company on a different foundation with a different focal point customer centricity and a different factor of production, you're not using humans are using data and technology as the building blocks of your business. The differences are quickly apparent, but actually they run much deeper. And I go back to my point earlier that at the end of the day, 20, 30 years later, we know that Walmart and Amazon became more and more and more different than other close the gap.  and technology can do that in a way that nothing else really can.  if I told you that you can buy a cheap airline airplane tickets, so a low cost airline, you would rightly assume that their chairs are going to be a little bit more cramped.  .Speaker 1    00:27:56    They won't serve you a meal, they'll charge you for checking baggage. And the peanuts wouldn't be quite as generous as the other guys to be nuts.  because low cost means low cost. And in our mind, that's what it means, an inferior product, but it's okay because I'm saving money. Technology has introduced this wild phenomenon, which is I'm saving money for a superior product. Amazon gives me incredible service and cost me less. Uber gives me incredible service and costs me less. Airbnb gives an incredible service, but costs me less. And this idea that you can crush costs, not at the expense of the product or the customer, but to the delight of the customer and other lower cost. Only technology can deliver that. And if you build a company using those building bricks, those building blocks, then over time, those things are going to manifest in more and more places in, in ever more powerful ways.  .Speaker 0    00:28:48    Hmm. Yeah. Fascinating.  your comment about how disruption is actually doing the disruption. It reminds me of this idea. I had a week ago where it's like often, I think sometimes the fish bowl determines the size of the fish in a way. So in a way, the, what disruption is happening technology is doing its it's creating this huge fishbowl for those let's say in the insurance industry who are willing to jump into this new fishbowl of what technology can do to provide us a lower costs, better experience for the customer. And it's really the size of the fishbowl. The size of this disruption, as you've mentioned, many times in past interviews is huge.  this is one of the biggest industries in the entire world.  and this disruption that's happening. The size of this disruptive fishbowl is just huge. And in a way that is what is going to determine in many ways, I'm not a hundred percent because also obviously Lemonade as they're coming, needs to execute and, be the best in that fishbowl. But that fishbowl ultimately probably has the biggest role in terms of how big the fish, ultimately becomes.  that's kind of the example.  I was thinking, what do you think of that?  .Speaker 1    00:30:02    I agree with you. I agree with you. I think even mediocre companies that do some of the right things will end up being successful. I think that insurance is, has many companies that have been doing just fine for decades or centuries without being extraordinary. So there is some of that, that's not what we strive for. We strive to be extraordinary, but, I think your thesis is solid. Yeah. And I also think that goes back to my point earlier about it's not a winner takes all industry there's room for the number two and the number 300 number four.  .Speaker 0    00:30:36    That's true. I mean, do you think though, in this more digital, let's say market or disruption, this bowl, that there are some inherent things about technology that make it where it's less distributive in terms of how many companies and how just equal the pie is shared amongst many players, meaning even though you won't be a hundred percent winner takes all market, do you think in some ways with technology and the internet and the advantages of scale that it provides, that it will be less of a diversified kind of a more concentrated market, this whole digital insurance market then maybe existing, traditional markets of insurance.  .Speaker 1    00:31:20    That's an interesting question. I'm not sure.  it is looking that way to my earlier point about, where is everybody, why aren't there a hundred lemonades contending for this?  it is looking that way that it may end up being just, one, two, three digital names. No, it's interesting. I, and this is also goes back to a question about modes and, and competition. One of our early investors was Google. And, a while ago we were, we had a, an interesting conversation with, Eric Schmidt and he was chatting about growing fast and capturing market share quickly. And he said that Google, in the early days they missed out on three markets. I think I'm not actually sure what it was. I've got a feeling it may be in China, South Korea and maybe Russia or Ukraine or one of those Eastern European countries, I think maybe.  .Speaker 1    00:32:20    And he said, Daniel, to this day in two out of those three markets, Google is nothing, which is amazing. It's this idea that the market may be huge, so marketers and their problem, but Mindshare is an issue. And part of the reason that we at Lemonade are moving fast is I do believe that there is some wet cement where there's a placeholder for the 21st century incarnation of insurance. What does it look like? The Google of kind of thing. And if you write your name in a cement while it's where to the engineers for a long time, if you miss that opportunity and somebody else writes, I mean, it's a lot of hard work to try and change that. And even though insurance companies are bombarding us with ads all day long and they've got propeller planes, dragging banners and Superbowl commercials and everything else.  .Speaker 1    00:33:14     so we know all the names that state farm and Allstate and the farmers and, all the insurance companies with the name, state and farm.  I still believe that there's actually a big part of the consumer's mindset that is waiting for. Okay, but what is the, what is the new version of that? And we are trying to imprint Lemonade on the consumer mind share in order to fill that space. So we're launching new products quickly, we'll launch new geographies quickly.  and in that sense, I think coming full kind of cycle back to your question, I'm not sure that there's room in the mind Mindshare for a lot of brands. Now, at the end of the day, you can name Google hard to name the second player, even though it's a stunningly big market, you can name Amazon, you can even Facebook hard to name the second time you name YouTube, but knows who the next biggest player in that space. So there may be some of those dynamics at play here as well. It would not be shocking to me.  .Speaker 0    00:34:13    Got it.  I'm curious, I wanted to ask you about kind of first principle thinking I've noticed, in many of just your toxin, your interviews and presentations, you talk about kind of how insurance ought to be and kind of what the, and what the experience ought to be. If  you put the customers at the priority at first place, and, you talk about how an insurance company may be, ought to be built in the 21st century with technology and the digital substrate.  can you expound or share a bit more on this first principle thinking like how it should be like, is this something that, was from the very early stages of the company, part of your DNA and how has it kind of over time? Is it something that you guys still think about, over time as well?  .Speaker 1    00:35:08    Yeah.  when you're taking on a, established anything established competitor industry process, I think it's, unless you come from that space and  it inside out, it's very hard to eke out optimization of that system, better than the incumbents themselves. So if we wanted to build another AIG or state any, I'm not picking on any of those companies, if we thought we could just do, let's just do what they're doing, but do it better. I think we would lose. I really do.  if you want to do it, it's not 10% better than them, but you want to do it 10 times better than them. I Ronica CLI you stand a better chance. I don't believe you can do 10% better than them. They know their game better than you do. You will lose 10 times better than them.  .Speaker 1    00:36:09    Okay? Now that forces you to forget everything that they're doing, because you're never going to get 10 X better by doing what they're doing and say, okay, I need to change substrate. I need to change building models. I need to change the whole thing. I've got to throw it all out and start from scratch. And that is the only way to get to dramatically better stuff. Geico has a wonderful commercial with 15 minutes can save you 15% or more. 15 minutes is great, but the median time to buy a policy and Lemonade is a 10th of that. It's 10 times faster. 90 seconds is literally the median time. You don't get to shave off 90% by trying to do what they're doing, but doing it better. Impossible. You've got to go back to the drawing board, the median savings for first-time buyer of insurance and Lemonade is 50%, not 15%, five, zero.  .Speaker 1    00:37:03    You don't get to do that, but you can't, you can't play back to my thing about Kasparov. You can't challenge because part of the chest and expect to beat him, you got to change the game. So we knew that were coming as outsiders to this industry, neither shine, or I have a background in insurance other than as consumers.  and so we had to play to our strengths. We had to say, okay, what do we know?  customer centric, innovation, we know technology, we know sharing economy. We know contemporary branding.  we have a grasp of behavioral economics. And one of our founding team members is professor Dan. Arielli the eminent, behavioral economist. What can we do? How would we do it? And then you're playing to your strengths. And then you're thinking about stuff from scratch and building it up from the ground up.  .Speaker 1    00:37:48    So it sounds like an early investors like go, you guys are nuts, don't stick to your knitting, do what you do, partner with a big insurance company and just, create a beautiful website. That's what you guys know how to do.  and it sounded like we were taking upon ourselves the hard route of doing everything, getting own licenses, getting on business model, doing an actuarial sciences. But I, I was convinced then I'm even more convinced in hindsight that it was the easier part, the less risky part than trying to have some kind of hybrid of trying to improve on legacy. We would have, we would have failed if we thought we knew how to do that. We would have done that. How, if you can find the 30% improvement on a 5 trillion industry, you don't need to do anything else.  I just don't believe in that.  .Speaker 0    00:38:36    Got it.  yeah, one of the striking things about the Lemonade story is how, you, you and Shai were to the insurance industry and how like that's struck me because oftentimes it takes like, many, many years for people really to understand the industry that they're disrupting. And for you guys to kind of come from almost an outsider kind of perspective in tech and, and to try to disrupt this multi-trillion dollar global industry.  it sounds very, very, it's, bold in the good sense.  and I'm wondering though, like, as you, took this on, were there some, mistakes, some, maybe some things that in the beginning, because you didn't have, let's say the intimate knowledge of insurance and the industry were there certain, like, were there some mistakes that you just look back on and you're like, Oh my gosh, I can't, we can't believe we did that in the early, early stages.  .Speaker 1    00:39:41     there are, I'll tell you one or two, I'm surprised there weren't a lot more, I think we got quite lucky as well, and there's a lot of luck in these things. There's no question to my mind, a lot more luck than we like to credit. And for us, the stars aligned and the gods have been kind to us.  but yeah, there are a few things that in retrospect you say, wow, we set out, we said, okay, we're gonna, we're not going to be dependent on legacy providers. We're going to build our own insurance carrier. And everyone said to me, you're not, we'll be okay. We went nuts.  .Speaker 1    00:40:19     and we decided to do, to, to get a license from the great state of New York, which is highly regarded as perhaps the most exacting regulator out of the 50 States, California, give them a run for the money, but it's between the two of them. And I think he was contrary. It was like, well, we want to build something durable, sustainable over a long time, you start, you take on the hardest challenges and then everybody else will fall in line. You start somewhere else. You may never make it to New York. And getting our license in New York was incredibly difficult, incredibly difficult. And we had we'd raise a ton of money by our standards. It was, Sequoia was one of our seed investors. It was the largest seed round in Sequoia's history. That'd been doing this since early seventies.  we've got gray hair, we've done this before.  .Speaker 1    00:41:12    We brought on board, some incredible people from the insurance industry. And we thought, okay, getting a license should be pretty straightforward. We'll fill out the paperwork. We got a top regulatory council. We did everything by the book and the license didn't come. And the licensed didn't come. And the licensed in common, we were giving, we were really getting desperate. The money was running low. We were started to think maybe we should go to London where they were saying, come here, we'll give you a license. The story has a happy ending. And we got a license. But in retrospect, I don't think we understood how high a bar we set ourselves. We wanted to set a bar, that we, we hoped we could clear. In retrospect, I think you flip that coin 10 times. Maybe it comes up once had, so some of the godless that we've run at the time, we were like a little bit headstrong, like, Oh, she'll be fine. She'll be fine. And retrospect, you look back and say crap. Wow. We could have absolutely have died there. Thankfully we didn't, but that was not smart. So there were a few of those moments for sure.  .Speaker 0    00:42:17    Got it. Interesting.  was going into the U S kind of as your first kind of big market, was that also kind of like if we're going to have credit ambitions be better, be able to do, do well in this kind of market of the U S  .Speaker 1    00:42:30    Yeah. And something like 50 cents on the dollar of spending by consumers on insurance has done in the U S  and for, it was really a question of New York as a financial center, California, as the tax center, we settled on New York, but yeah, it was definitely our first choice. We did consider London. And if it wasn't for I'm, I don't know if you can tell from the remanence of my accent, but I'm originally from London.  and while we were waiting for New York to give us a license, I got an Emissary from 10 Downing street and actually an invitation to go to 10 dimes, which I did, which for me was a really exciting thing. And they said to us, come here you, we are English speaking, and you can face America world. So part of the European union, Acquisio, it's the Patrick thing. And they said, next week we've got the Brexit vote, but we'll vote that down. And then everything will be great. The famous last words, it didn't quite play out that way.  .Speaker 0    00:43:30    Yeah, definitely.  yeah, it's interesting. What I, one of the things I'm picking up also, it's like having all of the foundational work of a unified kind of super lean, super efficient system that runs your running your, all of your systems, right? Your, your marketing, your signup, your application, your, your underwriting, your claims process, customer service is all just there. One of the interesting things is as you expand to different insurance sectors, you can take a long your entire system, because that's the only system you have, right. To process claims and sign up. I think like, in some ways, like, that makes sense, right? I mean, it's from a technological standpoint, but from the insurance industry standpoint, that's very like, novel, like very, I mean, because from what I'm learning is that the insurance industry, even their separate departments are mostly siloed, different software, and everything, they're not what you would think would be like, what people would think would be like one being industry at all. And so what kind of advantage does that give you guys when you guys are thinking of new markets? Like, for example, when you guys decided to go into pet insurance, or now you're thinking about life insurance, like, yeah. How does that factor into kind of your expansion plans?  .Speaker 1    00:44:53     hugely. So you're absolutely right. One of the beautiful things we launched pet three months ago, one of the beautiful things is that the marginal cost for us to launch this entire new category was, was marginal.  because it's the same policy management system, the same customer support system, the same claim systems there's incremental work to do, but these are not entirely new companies or, or, or systems that we have to put in place.  and by the way, that's true. The, the United States is actually almost like 50 different countries. It's regulated on a state by state basis and does its own rating engine and own compliance and everything else. And we've been able to create dozens of instantiations of the same software and even move over to Germany and Holland, and very soon France. So five years in market, and to have that kind of footprint, you could never do that without a digital, built, if you want to build on it on a digital infrastructure, but, but it goes deeper than that.  .Speaker 1    00:45:52    I'll give you, a colorful anecdote, but then I'll try and drive home that the more, the deeper point, we had an interesting case of somebody who, who wrote in or called a calmer what it is to our customer support and said, I'm thinking of buying renter's insurance. I have a question.  if my scuba gear is stolen from my car, is that a covered peril? Is that covered? It's an unusual question, but the answer is yes. It's COVID. So you went ahead and bought a policy and would you believe it, two weeks later, his scuba gear was stolen from his car now?  .Speaker 1    00:46:35     insurance fraud is a real thing.  but I think, I don't know this for fact, but I think he chose the one company in the world not to try that particular trick on, because I imagine that every other insurance company in the world, for the reasons that you discussed the customer support questions would have gone to probably an outsource team using a particular system. And God knows where. And then when the claim came in, it would be an entirely different set of software and totally different team that never have any way of knowing that this particular claim had an inquiry made three weeks ago about this exact same thing, which as you and I discussed red flags go up because you realize that that is a highly suspicious set of circumstances, but nobody else would, would catch that eliminated. We did for the reasons that we discussed the customer centricity, you see these data points, and we've had example after example, after example of that.  .Speaker 1    00:47:30    So that's kind of a colorful, example, or people, whatever we've posted about it, people wearing wigs and, and all of another kind of fraudulent things that software picks up in that otherwise you just wouldn't.   at the end of the day, there's one brain doing all of these interactions and it sees these things. If you speak to one person and I speak to another person and they meet me with a wig, I wouldn't know that they spoke to you without a wig a week ago, but if we are the same person, the same intelligence, then you catch these things.  but the deeper point is that not only do you catch fraud and stuff like that, but you start getting a much deeper understanding of people of customers. One of the things that we understood early on is that a lot of insurance is not about insurance property.  .Speaker 1    00:48:16    It's about ensuring people and you and I could drive the identical car or live in identical homes, and represent radically different risks. It's not enough to know, when the plumbing was installed in our building, that we both live in, or what the crime rate is in the neighborhood want to know whether we're the kind of people who leave the door unlocked to turn on the alarm who cleaned the gutters before winter, who don't leave candles and precarious positions in a kitchen and all of those kinds of things, because those are that's it's at that level, that insurance has won or lost though. Those are the competitive dynamics, just knowing when the plumbing was built is, is just too crude a measure. And if you buy into that, and I'm absolutely convinced about that, but ultimately in the business of looking after people, but also understanding the inherent risk of a person, then having a multifaceted system that sees different products, different stages from the marketing through to the claims, to the churning, to the credit cards, you start creating a much richer understanding of the human being that stands in front of you.  .Speaker 1    00:49:29    And then you can do everything better. You can sell them the right products. You can suggest the right coverages. You can pitch them a life product, or not pitch them a life product without filling up their inbox with nonsense.  when a claim comes determining whether this is one that you should be paying in three seconds, or whether there's flags and you really need a human being to be involved in this, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And then there's, that's where that flywheel kind of gets more and more powerful over time.  .Speaker 0    00:49:58    Yeah, that's  interesting.  I noticed, I want to ask you about geographic expansion along with the same lines.  I think I came across something of like, you're expanding. It was one of the countries in Europe where, I believe you, or one of your team members were saying, like, you don't really have people on the ground in that country, but yet you're expanding into that country, every which country it was. And it kind of struck me as like, wow, that's kind of, that's fascinating.  to be able to actually expand geographically, let's say across cultures and languages in some ways, but without having like a, a geographic physical presence right. In that country, could you kind of dive into that a little more? Is that possible actually to, expand geographically without physically, being on the ground as an insurance company?  .Speaker 1    00:50:51    Yes, it is. But it is, it is unusual. And it goes back to the, kind of the fundamental differences that we've discussed.  it's not the way it has been to date. So all the brands that we're familiar with in America stop at the water's edge. You go to the UK or to Europe, France, Germany, wherever you want to go. And you ask them about state, farm and Allstate and Geico and progressive. They've never heard those names. And you come to the U S and you talk about Generali or AXA or Alliance, or some of the largest names in Europe. And they've never, we've never heard those names in America. It's kind of stunning these huge conglomerates that stop at the water's edge and, and don't cross over. And part of it is there's a whole set of things, but you look at the skylines of our cities.  .Speaker 1    00:51:42    So, London has this beautiful, iconic building. It's the Swiss rebuilt, it's an insurance company. You think about the MetLife building in Manhattan. You think about the trans union building that is so iconic in the San Francisco skyline, and think about all the great cities of the world and think about their skylines and what you're really looking at in no small measure are insurance companies. They come into town, they build an iconic skyscraper and they stick 5,000 people in it. And they hope that that will, confer trust because it's got this kind of powerful image, and it's a practical necessity because it's a labor intensive business. You need a lot of people.  we take a different approach to the trust thing, but just sticking to the, to the geographic expansion in the United States, before we get to Europe in the United States, our largest markets are Texas and California.  .Speaker 1    00:52:39    It's, it's a lot of these are the largest States. We have zero employees in Texas, and we have zero employees in California. So we are servicing, the largest States in the union without having a physical presence, without building any skyscrapers. And as we're thinking about that, and the fact that it is really a digital product that we're able to resolve things, from afar digitally, we realized that consumers who get attracted to the kind of value propositions that Lemonade represents, which is good value, good values, and an amazing experience. Those are universally, compelling value propositions. And you think about digital brands, forget the insurance brands, but think about Spotify or Uber or Amazon, the consumers who are using in London or in Tokyo, or in Berlin or in San Francisco, have more in common with each other than they do with a traditional culture that surrounds them and these brands or Airbnb, they don't stop at the water's edge.  .Speaker 1    00:53:39    They are global in nature, and it is our aspiration. That Lemonade should be like that. We haven't achieved that aspiration, but that is the aspiration. And logically, it feels to us that it should be doable, that the value proposition, the user experience, these are not things that are unique to one culture. These are really things that humans like and digital, digitally native humans expect.  so the combination of saying consumers want this kind of things all over the place and the costs for us of opening up Germany back to your question. We have zero employees in Germany.  we do have employees in Holland because that's where we're licensed. That is our European headquarters. We're about to launch transferred no employees in France either. So we are able to expand to new geographies and new languages without putting the skyscraper then and sticking 5,000 people in it. So, yeah, it is possible.  .Speaker 0    00:54:32    Hmm. Interesting. I'm wondering, because to expand into another geography with a different language and even perhaps culture, et cetera, I'm imagining like, you need to localize the entire process, from marketing application, underwriting site, claims customer service. I mean, this is, it sounds like a pretty immense job to, to vocalize the entire product, but I imagine once you localize once or twice, then you start the flywheel or the wheel starts to kick in where you're like, Oh, okay, this actually is, to do your fourth or fifth or your 10th or 20th is a lot easier. Are you guys building that type of, I'm assuming that everything is in-house, built on your system? Like, are you guys kind of catching that sense that a, this localization, we can, expand this quite, large with our existing system.  .Speaker 1    00:55:30    Yes. So it's all done on the same system and it's all done in house. And, the big difference isn't technological because translating is not a big effort when you build the software, right?  it is regulatory for one. So the licenses that we have in the U S don't translate over to Europe, and then Europe is actually simpler. The regulation is less, cumbersome from our perspective than the American regulation and remarkably all 28 countries of the European union have a single regulatory framework. So actually there's a lot bigger differences between New Jersey, Connecticut and New York in terms of regulation than there is between France, Germany, and Holland. So the language has, might be different. The competitive dynamics may be different, but the one license that we have allows us to operate in each of those geographies, more freely than we could moving from one state to the other in the United States that said, I don't want to underplay the local dynamics each country there.  .Speaker 1    00:56:31    And this is why it's different to the United States. Each country has its own competitors, its own, not only language, but customer expectations and priorities and its quirks.  we discovered we launch in Germany. And so when you buy Lemonade insurance in the U S you download an app or you go to a website and you chat to Maya and she says, hi, I'm Maya, what's your name for yourself, Dave? And you can move on.  it took us a while to figure out what was getting stuck, but in Germany, people took exception to my being so forward. Like, I don't know you yet. What are you asking me? My name? And, and we found that we had to move that question to the end of the process when you're ready to buy the move and your trust. And now you're willing to give us your name, but when we put it up front, people got upset about that.  .Speaker 1    00:57:23    So we are finding that different European countries have different challenges and, we haven't cracked them yet. We still have a lot of work to do. We are still America focused. So we, we are for reasons that we discussed earlier, we are launching and mapping out territory really across the globe and across Europe at the moment.  but we're still a tiny company. We've got, 500 employees about a million customers, but 500 employees. So we do have a rather rigorous process of prioritizing our time and our money.  and at the moment America beats out the European countries in terms of the return on the incremental minute or dollar. And that's where most of our attention is.  .Speaker 0    00:58:08    Hmm. Got it.  I'm curious, does being based or headquartered in Israel, does it help, do you think your company have a, maybe more global perspective on things? Because I noticed like also with Lemonade, it's like, like my typical I w was when I would be looking at a company like you guys are expanding quite fast outside of, just the U S and to, European. And, it, it struck me as like,  a bit different, I feel like most companies, most insurance companies seem to be very domestically focused, you know?  but it seems like there's something in the DNA of Lemonade. That's a little bit different that maybe sees things a bit more Clovelly than, than, than others might.  can you speak to that a bit? I mean, is there some type of more global type of perspective that you guys have and, do you think that's an advantage when you are looking at the world?  .Speaker 1    00:59:09    So the company is actually headquartered in Manhattan, but from day one, we've been live in locations, both in Tel Aviv where we do our product R and D work and New York, which is our commercial and insurance operation lines.  which means that from day one, we were thinking about transatlantic communication and transatlantic travel. And certainly while I've, I've lived on multiple occasions in the U S not coming from the us, and having a perspective from the UK and from Israel, I'm from America certainly makes me feel more like a kind of citizen of the world. And I think that, yes, a lot of people can grow up in the centers in America, because America has so much to offer can sometimes, be more parochial in the vision, think about that business. Whereas if you're in London and certainly if you're in Tel Aviv, you must be thinking about export oriented businesses because there is no domestic market in Israel to speak up. So it's definitely been part of our mix, in a way that I imagine had we all just been native Americans born and bred in one of the great cities of America, they may have come less naturally to us.  .Speaker 0    01:00:21    How many people do you have in, Israel versus like, say your New York office, et cetera, worldwide.  .Speaker 1    01:00:32     we have somewhere between 150 and 200 people in Tel Aviv.  we have, I'd have to say something similar in Manhattan. It's lost its significance over the recent months because it's where the last nine months nobody's been at any office. So I've stopped, everyone's working from home. So I've stopped, gotta keep a cat or these things.  we have a growing operation out of Scottsdale Arizona, which is where we do a lot of our customer support in our claims operation. And we have a small team out of Holland Amsterdam.  .Speaker 0    01:01:07    Okay, great.  I want to dive into your brain and your thought process of how you're expanding across, not just jock geography, but now Leslie see different insurance sectors. And so, your first, product insurance was the renter's insurance. And I'm curious, like, was it mostly because it's like an unloved kind of sector?  there was a lot of opportunity, a great chance to,  get into kind of a starting a foothold and then to grow your presence. And then it was pet this a similar type of thought process. And then, I'm curious, just, you've recently announced, Oh, you've been getting into home insurance and now you've announced Guinea into life insurance. So kind of, what is your thought process in terms of, expanding across sectors?  .Speaker 1    01:01:57    So I actually, we were selling homeowner's insurance from the very first day that we launch. So September, 2016, we launched with in New York with renter's condo and home insurance, but rent is really was the focus.  and generally going into homeowners insurance was, because it seemed be relatively neglected. So it was a stunningly big business in the U S alone. You're talking about something like a hundred billion dollars a year is spent on homeowners insurance, but it was almost like a backwater compared to other auto had achieved a lot more direct to consumer. You think about Geico, progressive homeowners insurance was still in 95, 96% broker based. So it was a contrarian approach trying to look for places where the potential in the actual, as divergent as possible, because that's the breach you want to get in.  and as we entered it, we did find that with renters in particular, it was really playing to our strengths.  .Speaker 1    01:03:04    A lot of the things that we could do, selling policies, inexpensively, targeting young consumers, turning insurance from a conscious sales process to almost an impulse buy by presenting it on a Facebook ad and, and other kind of communications. We found that this was an area where even within homeowners that was just really neglected and there's consumers that there's up and coming amazing young consumers buying insurance for the first time, we think of them as just an incredible cohort of customers to, we feel privileged to serve them, but they want a very low interest to the incumbents. The premiums are very low, the cost of them with a broker. It doesn't make sense given that the premiums are so low. So the whole system was not optimized for that consumer so fast. That was incredible. About 90% of our customers are first-time buyers of insurance and our market share among first-time buyers of insurance is, is pretty remarkable, just a few years of market, but from early on, really from the get-go, we knew that what we want to do is use that advantage to acquire customers at a time that they don't want to deal with incumbents and the comments don't frankly, want to deal with them.  .Speaker 1    01:04:19     and we're competing with non-consumption, which is incredibly powerful, but then how do we grow with those customers? Because insurance is so extraordinary in that the lifetime value is just an order of magnitude or more, more than what you think about typically. So you may have a view on Peloton, may think it's amazing company. I don't know what your views on this, but you would at least ask yourself the question of whether people are still going to be riding bikes in their home five years from now. Maybe they will, maybe they weren't, you won't ask yourself whether there'll be insuring the home five years from now, and they absolutely will. And I don't know whether a cohort of Peloton customers today will be spending more or less than Panasonic five years. I do know that a cohort of insurance buyers will be spending more five years and not 10%, more, 20% more, but quite possibly 10 times more.  .Speaker 1    01:05:11    If you've got them early enough in they're buying a 60 policy, that they're going to go from 60 to 600 to 6,000 as they layer on top of more insurance needs. And insurance really tracks the, kind of the GDP of the individual, your network, and as your network increases, your life's responsibilities increase. Your insurance needs really move in lockstep with that. So for us, it was always about how do we earn the right to provide all the substance that our customers want? And in areas that we didn't provide them, we felt that we were letting them down. We got a lot of inquiries of products we don't have. I mentioned earlier that Google is one of our investors. They told us a lot. You can see this on Google trends that they're seeing as much search volume for Lemonade kind trends. As they're seeing for Lemonade home insurance. We've never said the words, car, insurance, and Lemonade. So there's a lot of pent up demand out there. And we feel like we're letting down our customers when we tell them, Oh, sorry, go to the other guys for that product. So we're very antsy. We're very impatient to cater to all of our customer's needs, not to let them down to earn the right, to capture the extra spend that is inevitably going to go somewhere to earn the right to, to ensure that it comes to us over time.  .Speaker 0    01:06:29    Okay, fantastic.  yeah, Dan, I want to thank you, for just extending your time generously to, to share.  I've I have so many more questions.  I think I need to reach out to you again, I'm going to ask maybe for another time, or even I would love to interview, Shai or even Tim, your CFO. I think you have an amazing team. Like you're just the different things that you guys all bring to the table is actually quite impressive. But, I think, yeah, as a shareholder, but also as someone who's just looking for the most innovative companies out there, this conversation is fascinating. I'm sure it's going to be for many others who view it as also. I want to thank you again.  .Speaker 1    01:07:07    Thank you. Thank you for so much for all of the thoughtfulness that goes into your questions and comments, and let's definitely do it again.  .Speaker 0    01:07:15    I hope that interview was helpful. I had a\"",
